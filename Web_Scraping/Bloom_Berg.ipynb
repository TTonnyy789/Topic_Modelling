      "['OPEC predicted an even tighter global oil market next year, as the group anticipates a much bigger demand increase than other major forecasters.  World oil consumption will climb by 2.2 million barrels a day next year to reach 104.3 million a day, the organization said on Thursday in its first detailed assessment of 2024. That’s the double the growth rate projected by the International Energy Agency, which advises consuming nations. The demand increase would outstrip the projected boost in supply from outside the cartel, pushing the world’s daily appetite for OPEC’s crude to 30.2 million barrels — or roughly 2 million barrels more than it pumped last month. That could allow the group to ease production constraints it’s making this year to shore up prices. Saudi Arabia and its partners have curbed output to balance markets amid a faltering global economy and unexpectedly robust supplies from exporters including Iran and Russia, both of which are both part of a wider alliance known as OPEC+. Oil prices climbed above $80 a barrel in London on Wednesday for the first time in two months as those supply curbs, which include extra unilateral cuts by the Saudis in July and August, tighten markets. Demand in China also appears robust despite shaky economic indicators.  The Paris-based IEA, which also released its latest outlook on Thursday, sees demand growing by 1.1 million barrels a day next year. The expansion in oil consumption will be limited by improving fuel efficiency and the burgeoning popularity of electric vehicles, the agency said.  The 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped an average of 28.2 million barrels a day in June, fractionally more than the previous month, according to the report.  The 23-nation OPEC+ alliance is formally due to hold a monitoring meeting next month, though no date has yet been set. The coalition is scheduled to have a full ministerial meeting on Nov. 26. ']\n",

      "['A rally in global stocks paused on Friday, though still on track for the best week since March, as earnings season in Europe and the US started to swing into gear. The Stoxx Europe 600 index was little changed at the open. Luxury-goods maker Burberry Group Plc slipped after reporting slowing sales growth in the Americas and a smaller-than-expected rebound in China. Swiss money manager Partners Group Holding AG gained more than 3% after assets under management roseBloomberg Terminal in the first half. US equity futures fluctuated after tech megacaps bolstered the S&P 500 to above 4,500 on Thursday. The reporting season also kicks off in the US today with lenders JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo and Citigroup Inc. A gauge of the dollar was steady, on track for its worst week since November. Treasury yields ticked higher. A gauge of global equities has rallied more than 3% since Monday as “disinflation” and “soft landing” became the buzzwords across trading desks, with investors unwinding bets on Federal Reserve tightening after soft US inflation data. “The market has been partying like it’s 1999 this week,” said Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. “It’s hard to stand in the way of that narrative at the moment regardless of what eventually happens.” Most stock indexes advanced in Asia. Stocks fluctuated in Japan as the yen headed for a seven-day winning streak, which would mark its best performance since 2018. The offshore yuan ticked higher. China has ample foreign exchange reserves and will “resolutely” prevent wild swings in the yuan exchange rate, People’s Bank of China Deputy Governor Liu Guoqiang said at a briefing Friday. The currency’s short-term movement cannot be predicted accurately, but it hasn’t deviated from its fundamentals, Liu added. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.1% in June from a year earlier, the smallest advance since 2020. The figures came just a day after data showed consumer prices increased at the slowest pace since 2021. “The Fed has already won the battle against inflation,” Raffaele Bertoni, head of debt capital markets at Gulf Investment Corp., said on Bloomberg Television. “If they want to be serious in maintaining inflation under control, the focus should be more on the reduction of the balance sheet or the quantitative tightening rather than increasing rates further.” Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly, however, told CNBC Thursday that it’s too soon for policymakers to say they have done enough to return US inflation to their target. Fed Governor Christopher Waller also said he expects the US central bank will need to raise rates twice more this year to bring inflation down to its target. In commodities, oil headed for a third weekly gain as supply disruptions in Africa and a reduction in shipments from Russia tightened the market.

      "['Bonds rallied for a second day as traders bet an aggressive streak of global interest-rate hikes is close to ending, bolstered by optimism inflation in the world’s biggest economy will continue to slow. Short-dated bonds led the advance with two-year US Treasury yields falling as much as 14 basis points to 4.61%, the lowest level in nearly a month. The rate on similarly-dated UK securities also fell, taking a drop over the past two days to nearly 30 basis points, the biggest since March. Meanwhile, benchmark US 10-year US Treasury yields were down about 9 basis points to 3.77%. The recent inflation data lifts “our level of conviction that the July hike will be the final one,” Deutsche Bank economist Justin Weidner wrote in a note with his colleagues, regarding the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy actions. Data Wednesday showed US consumer prices rose less than expected, undermining the case for more tightening. The consumer price index rose 3% last month from a year ago, the smallest advance in more than two years. Core CPI — which economists view as the better indicator of underlying inflation — advanced 4.8%, also the lowest since 2021. On Thursday, US Treasuries extended the rally after a report showed US producer prices barely rose in June from a year earlier. It’s the moment bond bulls had been awaiting. Stronger-than-expected economic data out of the US and signs of sticky inflation in the UK had spurred a brutal selloff in the market over the past months, sending yielding to multiyear highs.  “The bond rally currently has a strong momentum, which may bring some extension of the moves,” said Evelyne Gomez-Liechti, a rates strategist at Mizuho. A tight labor market and resilient services sector, however, still pose upside risks to the US inflation outlook, she added. Amid the rally in global government debt, the US Treasury department sold $18 billion 30-year bonds at a rate of 3.91%. Despite the day’s gains, it was the highest 30-year auction yield since November.  US Treasury 30-Year Bond Yields 3.91% at Auction (Table)Bloomberg Terminal In the US, the odds of another Fed hike after July are quickly receding. Traders are no long fully pricing another 50 basis points of hikes for the European Central Bank. And in the UK, they now see the Bank of England taking the key rate to as high as 6.25%, compared with a high of 6.5% priced earlier this week. Comments from ECB officials Thursday encouraged the repricing. Governing Council member Ignazio Visco said “we’re not very far” from the peakBloomberg Terminal in interest rates. His colleague Yannis Stournaras saidBloomberg Terminal the ECB’s plan to raise interest rates this month is not a “holy promise”. “It’s time to begin extending duration as rates are likely near peak,” Shamik Dhar, chief economist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, wrote in a note. “Fixed income presents an attractive risk-return profile, especially relative to risk assets more sensitive to growth.”']\n",

      "['The dollar has defied predictions of a prolonged slump since at least the beginning of the year but top money managers say it’s now on borrowed time as US exceptionalism wanes.  The greenback is weakening as US interest rates near a peak and the Federal Reserve’s aggressive tightening begins to take a toll on the world’s largest economy, investors say. That will set the stage for the likes of the yen, kiwi and emerging-market currencies such as the Brazilian real and Colombian peso to strengthen, according to AllianceBernstein and UBS Asset Management. The dollar’s resilience has confounded bears who had warned that the currency was headed for a multi-year decline following a surge in 2022. But there’s a growing conviction that they may finally be proven right as easing inflation backs the case for the US central bank to wrap up its rate-hike campaign in the coming months.  “Broadly we would probably assume that the US dollar has had its peak and there might be room for other currencies to perform better in the latter half of 2023-2024,” said Brad Gibson, co-head of Asia Pacific fixed income at AB. This is because the US economy will slow and the Fed is likely to start easing, he said. The reaction to Wednesday’s cooling US inflation data appear to justify the tide of bearish calls against the greenback. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slumped to a 15-month low, with the gauge now down over 11% from a September peak. Hedge funds had been bracing for weakness, as they turned net sellers of the dollar for the first time since March, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission aggregated by Bloomberg.  Against this backdrop, investors are lining up their bets on which currencies will gain from the greenback’s decline. The yen is seen as a prime beneficiary with bulls seeing catalysts from fears of a US recession to narrowing yield differentials to speculation the Bank of Japan may tweak its ultra-loose policy in the coming months. Jim Leaviss, chief investment officer of public fixed income at M&G Investments which oversees $366 billion, is shorting the dollar against the yen.  “There are lots of currency opportunities out there at the moment,” said Leaviss. “Quite a few of the emerging market currencies look cheap.”  Every Group-of-10 currency has strengthened against the greenback over the past month. The yen rallied 4% in the past five sessions, the Swiss franc rose to the strongest since 2015, while the euro and pound reached their highest in more than a year. Emerging currencies have also advanced, with a MSCI gauge of such assets up 2% this year after sliding 4% in 2022. Bloomberg’s dollar gauge extended losses by about 0.1% on Thursday.   For UBS Asset’s Shamaila Khan, Latin American currencies including those of Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Colombia are likely to outperform. Every one of them has strengthened against the dollar this year, with the Colombian peso advancing 18% against the greenback.  “We like them due to the high yield, double digit carry they offer,” said New York-based Khan, head of fixed income for EM and Asia Pacific for the $1.1 trillion asset manager. “We expect a weaker dollar in the second half.”  Lombard Odier’s Christian Abuide also sees the real gaining, along with the Swiss franc, euro and yen.  “We favor the high carry yield offered by emerging markets such as the Brazilian real, which is benefiting from an environment of falling inflation and improving fiscal and external balances,” Abuide, head of asset allocation, wrote in a recent report.  What Bloomberg Strategists Say... If you continue to believe, as we do, that the Fed rate will soon peak (though no 2023 cuts), in a softening (not hard landing) US growth story and in a continued risk-on market context, it makes sense to believe in a weaker dollar performance into 2H. - Audrey Childe-Freeman, chief G-10 FX strategist. For the full note, click hereBloomberg Terminal Others are less certain the dollar will weaken further. “We haven’t been taking much risk” in foreign exchange, said Brendan Murphy, a money manager at Insight Investment which oversees over $880 billion. “You still have these high and rising real rates, and you have growth concerns globally and the US — on a relative basis — is really doing better than say Europe or China.”  There are arguments in favor of a stronger dollar. The Fed may keep rates higher for longer if inflation doesn’t fall back within the central bank’s target. The world’s reserve currency also tends to strengthen amid risk aversion and worsening recession fears may spur renewed strength in the greenback.  Hedge Funds Abandon Bullish Dollar Bets on Peak Fed Speculation Dollar Falls to Lowest in Three Months Ahead of Inflation Data Yen Strengthens Through 140 as Bulls Bet on Turning Point But, overall there appears to be a growing consensus that the greenback’s best days are over for now. Peaking US rates “takes away one of the supports for the dollar,” said Rajeev De Mello, a 36-year markets veteran and money manager at GAMA Asset Management, who is buying the Indian rupee and Mexican peso against the greenback. “That first phase of buying other currencies outside the dollar is already in motion.”']\n",

The outage of the roughly 250,000 barrel-a-day Sharara field follows disruptions at the country’s El Feel area and Nigeria’s Forcados oil terminalBloomberg Terminal. “This event is garnering heightened attention as the market has recently inflected from a surplus to a deficit,” said Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth. “The macro backdrop has improved, making every barrel important.” Prices recently pierced key technical levels such as the 100-day moving average, breaking out of the tight trading range they’ve been stuck in for two months after. Now traders are keeping a close watch on whether futures will cross above their 200-day moving averages — around $82.50 for Brent and $77.30 for WTI — which could trigger more buying.  Softening US inflation, which has prompted some optimism that the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking cycle may be nearing an end, is also supporting the commodity.  While the International Energy Agency said global oil demand won’t grow as fast as previously expected this year due to the faltering economies of developed nations, the agency still sees record demand this year. In a separate report, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries predicted an even tighter global oil market next year, as the group anticipates a much bigger demand increase than other major forecasters.

      "['A minority shareholder is set to wrest full control of a top Kazakh bank as part of a settlement to end the biggest asset dispute since Nursultan Nazarbayev resigned as president in 2019, according to people familiar with the matter. Under the terms of a deal to be announced soon, Galimzhan Yessenov will increase his stake in First Heartland Jusan Bank to almost 100% from near 20%, the people said, declining to be identified as the information isn’t public. The seller is Jusan Technologies, a UK-based company that was linked to a foundation set up by Nazarbayev. In response to a Bloomberg query, Jusan Bank confirmed that “a constructive settlement” had been reached but provided no further details. The standoff has been playing out against the backdrop of efforts by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to consolidate his control over the $226 billion economy following the signingBloomberg Terminal of a law on clawing back assets the government deems illegally obtained.  In the aftermath of the worst riots in the history of independent Kazakhstan a year and a half ago, Tokayev moved to sideline many allies and family members of his predecessor Nazarbayev and vowed to take on the country’s entrenched oligarchs. The coming settlement will resolve a legal battle that’s simmered for about five months since Kazakh prosecutors started proceedings to stop the transfer of the bank’s ownership to Jusan Technologies. The US parent company of Jusan Technologies then counter-sued the Kazakh government, accusing it in a federal lawsuitBloomberg Terminal in Nevada of attempting to seize control of assets worth over $1.5 billion. Yessenov earlier sued Jusan Technologies and its subsidiaries over the value of his stake in the bank and dividend payouts he said he was owed. Jusan Bank and its parent company have denied “any affiliationBloomberg Terminal” with Nazarbayev or members of his family.  Yessenov will pay for assets that also include minority stakes in the country’s biggest mobile operator and state-run Kazakhtelecom, the people said, without specifying the amount. As part of the Jusan deal, the parties agreed to revise upward the value of Yessenov’s stake, acquired after his ATF Bank mergedBloomberg Terminal with Jusan, the people said. The settlement includes compensation for unpaid dividends for Yessenov and factors in the difference in the valuation of his stake, they said.  Jusan has paidBloomberg Terminal more than $500 million in dividends after receiving over $3 billion in state support in 2018 and 2019 as part of a bailoutBloomberg Terminal that was among the country’s biggest in recent years. Defaults and debt restructurings by Kazakh banks have forced Nazarbayev’s government to provide at least $18 billion in state aid going back more than a decade.  In return for payments to Jusan Technologies, Yessenov gets control of the bank’s Kazakh parent, the people said. Under the terms, Jusan Technologies will also offload to Yessenov a stake of about 9% in Kazakhtelecom and a 15% shareholding in mobile operator Kcell, they said.  The deal is conditional on almost all of Yessenov’s money ending up with a Kazakh university and schools supported by the New Generation Foundation, which replaced the Nazarbayev Fund in Jusan’s group ownership restructure in 2021, according to the people. A spokeswoman for Yessenov declined to comment. No one answered calls to the public relations agency for Jysan Holding, a parent for Jusan Technologies, and it didn’t immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. No one was also available to comment at the Justice Ministry, which represents the Kazakh government in courts abroad, and it didn’t immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.  “We are very encouraged that a constructive settlement has been reached that enables the bank to to capitalize on great opportunities for growth,” Jusan Bank’s press service said. “It is a positive outcome for all parties.”']\n",

      "['A rush by overseas buyers for Chinese gallium — a niche-but-critical metal that’s soon to be subject to export controls — has eased off as the pace of inquiries slows and local prices stabilize. Inquiries from foreign buyers have dissipated, researcher Shanghai Metals Market said in a note, citing market participants. Risks are rising as shipments may not able to leave before the curbs kick in next month, it said. China announced the restrictions on gallium as well as a second metal, germanium, earlier this month in a move seen as an escalation of the country’s tit-for-tat trade war on technology with the US and Europe. The two metals are crucial to parts of the semiconductor, telecommunications and electric-vehicle industries, and the curbs prompted US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to voice her concern during a recent visit to Beijing. After an initial gain, local gallium prices have steadied. The free-on-board price has been unchanged at $290 a kilogram for the past two days, according to Asian Metal Inc. That follows a 16% jump after the announcement of the restrictions, which require exporters to apply for licenses from the commerce ministry. Chinese prices may drop later this year as the curbs keep more supply at home, exacerbating a domestic surplus, according to SMM. China is the top producer of primary gallium, with capacity of over 800 tons a year, it said.  Global gallium prices have also steadied after a spike. This week, they’ve risen just 1.5% to $331 a kilogram, following a 27% surge last week as buyers rushed to lock in supply before the Chinese curbs start on Aug. 1.']\n",

The Southeast Asian country intends to raise $1 billion in Islamic bonds, also known as sukuk bonds, Diokno said in an interview Thursday on the sidelines of an event in Toronto.  “We want to penetrate the Middle East market,” said Treasurer Rosalia de Leon, adding that banks don’t have a mandate for the transaction yet. “We’re working on the structure” of the notes, she said. The volume of outstanding sukuk bonds during the 12 months ended June 30 grew by 10% compared to the prior-year period and for the first time exceeded $800 billion, Fitch Ratings said in a reportBloomberg Terminal Thursday. While issuance may slow in the third quarter, it is expected to pick up in the final three months of the year, Fitch said.  The government seeks to ease its fiscal burden and bring the budget shortfall to 3% of economic output by the end of president Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s term in 2028, from around 7% last year. The planned borrowing — potentially consisting of a 5-year and a 10-year tranche — may take place later this year, subject to market conditions, de Leon said. “We are looking at 10 years, but we are also being advised that the sweet spot would be five years,” she said.  The Philippines is among Asia’s fastest-growing economies, beating growth expectations in the first quarter. Gross domestic product in the three months through March rose 6.4% from a year earlier, compared to a 6.2% median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.

      "['Luxury tycoon Francois-Henri Pinault is in advanced discussions to buy a majority stake in Creative Artists Agency, according to people familiar with the matter, potentially adding another international trophy asset to the portfolio of a French billionaire. The talent agency, backed by private equity firm TPG, could fetch a valuation of at least $7 billion, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the information isn’t public. The talks, which have come to light just as Hollywood writers and actors go on strike together for the first time in six decades, could still end without an agreement, one of the people said. If Pinault succeeds, the deal would show how French billionaires continue to broaden their reach beyond the businesses that made them wealthy in the first place. The Pinault family is the biggest shareholder in Kering SA, the owner of brands such as Gucci and Bottega Veneta. Via holding company Artemis, they also control a range of other prestigious assets such as auction house Christie’s and vineyards like Chateau Latour in Bordeaux. Rival Paris-based luxury firm LVMH, controlled by the world’s second-wealthiest person, Bernard Arnault, owns labels ranging from Louis Vuitton to Christian Dior to Dom Perignon. LVMH, the world’s largest fashion conglomerate, had already made inroads into the entertainment world by signing up Pharrell Williams as men’s creative director at Louis Vuitton, following collaborations with the likes of Rihanna.   Meanwhile, Patrick Drahi, founder of French telecoms company Altice, acquired auctioneer Sotheby’s in 2019.     Representatives for CAA and TPG declined to comment, while a representative for Pinault didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. CAA, founded by Michael Ovitz, Ron Meyer and several partners in 1975, has long been one of the premier power brokers in Hollywood, though the so-called superagents later left for new ventures.  The Los Angeles-based firm offers talent management services and packaged content for Hollywood studios. The firm’s site offers information on how to book Salma Hayek, Francois-Henri Pinault’s wife, as a speaker.  CAA, like its rivals WME and United Talent Agency, is backed with funds managed by a private equity firm.  In 2010, TPG acquired a 35% stake in CAA. Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, the asset manager in 2014 boosted its ownership share to 53% to take control of the business at a $1.1 billion valuation. TPG via CAA has made at least one major add-on deal since then. CAA agreed to buy a smaller companion agency in ICM Partners two years ago. A potential sale of CAA comes at a critical time for show business. The industry has been trying to adjust to quickly evolving streaming trends in a quest to reach profitability. It’s also facing a potentially crippling strike, with Screen Actors Guild picketing set to begin Friday in New York and Los Angeles, according to the union’s Twitter account.

      "['Chinese President Xi Jinping finally appears to be extending an olive branch to private businesses battered in recent years by regulatory crackdowns and the world’s most restrictive Covid-19 policies. Officials have made a series of high-profile actions designed to telegraph the Chinese government’s backing for private firms, as the nation’s post-pandemic recovery risks being caught in a confidence trap. The Chinese leader has vowed to treat foreign investors better and called for greater opening up in recent weeks.  That mission has seen top officials roll out the red carpet for Elon Musk and other executives, draw a line under a tech crackdown that tanked the world’s biggest IPO, and even visit US-based Bain & Company’s Shanghai office in an apparent end to immediate worries about a probe into consultancies that spooked global investors. The Hang Seng Tech Index is on track for its best week this year following Beijing’s positive signals to the sector, although the gauge fellBloomberg Terminal about 0.2% Friday afternoon in Hong Kong.  China’s outreach comes as the nation’s post-pandemic recovery loses steam. The nation’s property market is showing signs of weakness, exports are shrinking and deflationary risks loom. Without “the lure of a rapidly growing economy,” China’s is finding it difficult to attract Western business, said Diana Choyleva, chief economist at Enodo Economics, a London-based research firm focused on China.  “Deflationary signs add to the impression of a troubled economy, making it harder for Beijing to recruit foreign capital to its efforts to counter US power,” she added. Perhaps China’s clearest signal of a shift in attitude toward the private sector was the praise heaped this week on tech companies, which have seen billions in market value wiped out due to Xi’s regulatory crackdown.  Chinese Premier Li Qiang called Internet firms the “trailblazers of the era” in a meeting on Wednesday with senior executives from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd. Meanwhile, the nation’s top economic planning agency praised major online platforms for supporting the nation’s technological innovation.  China’s efforts to convince investors the tech sector is open for business will be hampered by recent moves to insert Communist Party officials on boards and reduce big firms’ market shares, said Andrew Collier, a managing director at Orient Capital Research Inc. “Investors know there are sharp limits on growth for tech firms and, therefore, investing in them is highly risky,” he said. “There will be some opportunities for new listings and short-term trading options but the overall sector is no longer as attractive as it once was.” Still, the recent gestures at least imply authorities want to help create more jobs, bolster the real economy and drive the country’s competitive edge internationally, said Willer Chen, an analyst at Forsyth Barr Asia.  Another sign of encouragement for foreign investors: Chinese financial regulators have invited some of the world’s biggest investors to a symposium next week, Reuters reportedBloomberg Terminal, citing three unidentified people. China has already removed one major barrier to international business exchanges in the form of Covid controls that closed borders for three years. Members of China’s powerful Politburo met with Musk and Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., in May, signaling that the return of such executives is welcome. Business delegations from Japan and France have also visited this year, while the chief executive officers of Intel Corp. and Mastercard Inc., as well as senior representatives from Western Digital Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., are in China this week, according to an agenda seen by Bloomberg News.  Xi himself greeted US billionaire Bill Gates in Beijing last month calling him “the first American friend I’ve met in Beijing this year.” That warm message contrasted with the tougher meetings the Chinese leader and other officials had with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken days later. The world’s largest economies are locked in a trade war that’s seen both sides impose export controls. A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China earlier this year found that the Asian giant is no longer a top three investment priority for a majority of US firms, as geopolitical tensions simmer. There are some early signs frictions are easing. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said her meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing last week had put ties on a “surer footing.” Still, Yellen told her counterparts in Beijing that “coercive” and “punitive” actions against US firms in China were a major concern for businesses. Earlier this year, China conducted a series of raids on consultancy firms relied on by foreign investors. US consultancy Bain & Company said this week it had “warmly” welcomed a visit by top Shanghai officials days before Yellen’s trip. That marked officials’ first known visit to the firm since a wider probe of the industry over national security concerns. Despite China’s efforts Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis, said private sector “confidence has clearly not been restored.” She identified three main lingering problems: muted domestic demand, tighter national security regulations and the US and European Union stepping up exports controls to China.  “Being present in China is becoming a liability – rather than an asset – as far as global investors’ reactions are concerned,” she added. Tian Xuan, a Tsinghua University professor, said the government should formulate red lines so companies can operate with confidence in a frontpage article Wednesday in the state-run Securities Times. Distilling what was at stake for Xi’s government, Tian said: “What is the most important problem in the private economy now? It’s the lack of confidence among private entrepreneurs.”']\n",

For years, the South Asian nation has relied on outdated surveys to quantify everything from gross domestic product to inflation. Most of India’s economic data is based on numbers collected more than a decade ago, when smartphones were rare and apps like Uber or Zomato hadn’t yet revolutionized the way Indians travel, eat and shop. This means the consumer price index — which is used by the central bank to set borrowing costs — doesn’t fully capture the texture of modern India. The statistics ministry still collects sales data for near-obsolete items like audio cassettes, making it difficult for market watchers to measure the true strength of the world’s fifth-largest economy and form a nuanced picture about its demographics and consumption habits. “We have programs for people below the poverty line, but we don’t know the number of poor people,” said Pronab Sen, India’s former chief statistician. It’s an alarming problem for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who’s pitching India as the next big market for global investment and trade. Economists warn that the risk of policy errors will rise unless India moves quickly to update figures and remove barriers to accessing reliable data. “Our ability to track inflation effectively has been severely undermined,” Modi’s economic advisor Bibek Debroy and his colleague Aditya Sinha wroteBloomberg Terminal in a column for The Hindu this week. “Our tools for understanding and managing our economic reality are grossly inadequate.” Take the case of India’s services sector. The segment is now responsible for roughly half of a household’s spending, though it holds a 24% weight in India’s CPI, which hasn’t been updated since 2012. In another example, Indians spend less than 30% on food, though that metric comprises about half of the CPI basket. “What we cannot measure we cannot manage,” Chief Statistician G.P. Samanta said at an event last month, where he vowed to “create an ecosystem where data guides policymakers on the path of sustainable development.” After years of delays, the government started a new consumer expenditure survey in 2022, which captures consumption patterns in India and will help in policy formation. But the survey won’t feed into GDP or CPI metrics for at least two years, forcing analysts to use alternative indicators like air traffic and fuel demand to check the pulse of India’s economy.  To more accurately estimate GDP, the government has also made a list of 200 critical data sources, according to people familiar with the matter. The list includes goods and services tax collections, company filings and e-way bills for interstate movement of goods. India’s statistics ministry is pressing other government departments to share information in a timely manner to reduce lags in data reporting, the people said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private. The statistics ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment. The issue is not limited to outdated numbers. Frequent revisions to existing data have added Bloomberg Terminalto frustrations, making it difficult to predict where one of the world’s fastest-growing economies is headed — and raising accusations among India’s political opposition that the numbers have been tampered with. Data revisions in recent years made India’s growth appear impressive during a devastating cash ban. During a later revision, economic contraction from the pandemic narrowed, making the country’s recovery appear bouncier. Kunal Kundu, a Societe Generale GSC Pvt. economist, said forecasting growth in India is a “hazardous task,” partly because the numbers are so elastic. Gross domestic product for last quarter surprised many when it came in one percentage point higher than estimates. “The reason everybody got this wrong is the alarming regularity with which the data is getting revised,” he said. Officials now avoid leaning too heavily on the government’s own figures. For instance, rather than use “bad data,” economists at the Reserve Bank of India are likely using a combination of intuition and inflation numbers to set interest rates, according to Sen. “Monetary policymakers supplement official estimates with information on auxiliary variables to have a firmer assessment and minimize policy errors emanating from data revision,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in June. India’s data collection problem has several roots. A staff shortage in the statistics ministry has slowed progress on the consumer expenditure survey, as well as conducting a new nationwide census, which hasn’t been updated since 2011. The number of field investigators has also broadly remained stagnant since the 1970s, though India’s population has grown by several hundred million people. Today, loosely trained contractors are responsible for collecting the bulk of demographic information across India. With national elections less than a year away, few analysts believe Modi’s administration will release sensitive data ahead of voting, particularly around issues like employment. The infusion of politics into data-collection has frustrated many of India’s top statisticians, who’ve emphasized that the nation can’t reach its growth goals if nobody knows what’s happening on the ground. “There is a credibility crisis,” said P.C. Mohanan, the former head of India’s National Statistical Commission, who resigned in 2019 to protest the government’s decision to withhold a jobs report.  “In the absence of real and credible data, people will go for all kinds of interpretation and that is a problem,” he said. “Who knows what the right picture is, because there is no survey.”']\n",

      "['It now takes more than $650,000 a year to be among the top 1% of wealthiest households in the US. And you need much more than that in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. That’s according to a  new study from  financial information provider SmartAsset, which ranked states by the income threshold required to join the ultra-wealthy. The firm found that households earning about $953,000 annually before taxes are in the top 1% in Connecticut, making it one of two states, along with Massachusetts, where it requires more than $900,000 to make the list. New Jersey, meanwhile, was fourth on the list at $817,000, higher than its neighbor New York. In fact, while the money required to make the 1% rose in most states compared with 2022, New York was stagnant at about $777,000. “It’s easier to get into the 1% in New York than it ever has been,” said Jaclyn DeJohn, SmartAsset’s managing editor of economic analysis.  The income thresholds for the top 1% in various states shift based on a number of factors, including the migration of high-earners, changes in income and how taxes were filed, DeJohn noted. For the study, SmartAsset analyzed 2020 data from the IRS for individual tax filers and adjusted those figures to May 2023 dollars using the Consumer Price Index. The report noted that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the top 1% of US households hold more than a third of the country’s wealth.']\n",

      "['Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard, an influential voice who called for aggressive interest-rate hikes to fight the recent inflation surge, resigned after 15 years in the position to become dean of a university business school. Bullard, 62, stepped down from his post as head of the bank effective Thursday. He will fully depart Aug. 14 to become the inaugural dean of the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business at Purdue University, the St. Louis Fed said in a statement Thursday.  Bullard has been pushing the Fed since mid-2021 to take more-aggressive steps to curb the fastest inflation in decades. He argued that the Fed was wrong to consider price pressures “transitory” and was among the first to call for jumbo-sized hikes, including three-quarter point moves. Read More: Bullard Becomes Wall Street’s Go-To Guy for Hint of a Fed Pivot Bullard, who doesn’t vote on rate decisions this year, has been seen as a bellwether because his views have sometimes foreshadowed policy changes. He published a paper in 2010 titled “Seven Faces of the Peril,” which called on the central bank to avert deflation by purchasing Treasury notes. That was followed by a second round of bond buying. While Bullard remains at the bank in an advisory capacity over the next month, he has recused himself from his monetary policy role on the Federal Open Market Committee and other related duties and has ceased all public speaking, the St. Louis Fed said. “Bullard was an intellectual force on the FOMC, at once dovish but recently on the hawkish end with strong theoretical appeals for getting ahead of the inflation issue,” said Derek Tang, economist with LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics. “His absence will lessen the discourse power of the hawks and put more weight on similarly vocal but dovish peers” like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee. The St. Louis Fed’s No. 2 official, Kathleen O’Neill Paese, becomes interim president effective immediately. The bank’s board will begin a search that’s “robust, transparent, fair and inclusive,” according to the statement. Bullard’s departure will have “just a very small impact” on the rate path in 2023, “marginally making a second hike less likely,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide Life Insurance Co.  “As a non-voting member he still gets to express his opinion and could influence others modestly,” she said. Fed officials are expected to raise their benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point at their July 25-26 meeting, after holding rates steady last month in a range of 5% to 5.25%. Policymakers have penciled in two more rate hikes this year, according to their median forecast released after the June gathering. Tang said he doesn’t expect the vacancy to change the outlook, given Powell’s commitment to keeping upward pressure on rates until officials are sure inflation is contained.  In addition, the St. Louis Fed board tends to be among the more hawkish in the Fed system — it was one of four bank boards that recently sought a quarter-point increase in the discount rate — and its interim leader is likely to support further tightening, he added. Bullard, speaking before the Fed’s last policy meeting, said he expected policymakers would have to raise rates two more times this year to curb price pressures. “I think we’re going to have to grind higher with the policy rate in order to put enough downward pressure on inflation and to return inflation to target in a timely manner,” he said at a May 22 event in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Bullard’s departure will leave a third vacancy on the Fed’s 19-member rate-setting committee. Economist Adriana Kugler is awaiting confirmation as governor on the Fed board, and the Kansas City Fed is still searching for a permanent leader to succeed Esther George, who retired as the bank’s president in January.  Bullard, who was the longest tenured among the current regional Fed presidents, had given no hint that he was considering an early departure from the bank. He didn’t face mandatory retirement at 65 for several years. David Andolfatto, an economist who left the bank last year to head the University of Miami’s economics department and has continued to visit the bank, said the move came as a “shock.” Andolfatto said Bullard’s academic background made him appreciate the role of theory in interpreting data and developing policy recommendations. “He did not dissent often, but when he did he was always proved right,” he said. “He was always ahead of the curve.” Bullard cast four dissenting votes during his tenure on the FOMC: once in March of 2022, favoring a larger interest-rate increase, and three times before the pandemic in favor of easier policy. A native of Forest Lake, Minnesota, Bullard went to study economics at St. Cloud State University and earned his doctorate at Indiana University. Bullard was selected for his new position at the conclusion of an eight-month international search, with the goal of building “a premier business school in the country for a tech-driven free-market economy,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said in an interview. “I was blown away by both his leadership track record and by how deeply and innovatively he thinks as a scholar,” he said.']\n",

      "['It was a day that started with something of a bang: the charismatic Alex Mashinsky, former chief executive officer of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network under arrest and charged with fraud.  In a flurry of enforcement activity, the US Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission all filed lawsuits Thursday against both Mashinsky and Celsius itself.  Allegations against Mashinsky ranged from pumping up the price of CEL, the lender’s native token, to wire fraud. Mashinsky has pleaded not guilty and will be released on bail after agreeing to a $40 million personal recognizance bond.  Read: Celsius and Mashinsky: The Most Striking Indictment Details Then, shortly before noon, a judge issued a long-awaited ruling in the case of the SEC v Ripple Labs Inc. that sent crypto Twitter into a frenzy and token prices soaring. US District Judge Analisa Torres held that XRP, the token associated with Ripple Labs and central to the case, is a security when offered to institutional investors but not the general public.  “Institutional buyers would have understood that Ripple was pitching a speculative value proposition for XRP with potential profits to be derived from Ripple’s entrepreneurial and managerial efforts,” the judge wrote.  Read: Ripple Tokens Sold to Public Are Not Securities, Judge Says But Torres ruled that finding didn’t apply to programmatic investors, meaning the broader public. She said there was no evidence that such investors could parse the many statements made by Ripple about XRP, and found that many statements cited by the SEC may not have been shared with the broader public. Whether cryptocurrencies are securities has been a major question hanging over the industry, which has long fought efforts to regulate it by arguing that the tokens do not meet the necessary criteria.  XRP almost doubled, soaring to as much as 94 US cents on Thursday before easing back to 78 cents as of 1:20 p.m. on Friday in Singapore. An offshoot of XRP, Stellar’s XLM, also surged. Other tokens that were recently described as unregistered securities by the SEC increased too: Solana is up about 30% since the ruling and Cardano 25%. Bitcoin held a 3% gain to roughly the highest since June 2022, while Ether breached $2,000. “Judge Torres’ decision in Ripple is a huge win for the cryptocurrency and digital asset industry,” said Arthur G. Jakoby, co-chair for Securities Litigation and Enforcement at the law firm Herrick Feinstein LLP. “If upheld on appeal, this decision significantly narrows the SEC’s jurisdiction over the crypto market.” Shares of crypto-dependent companies also rallied. Coinbase Global Inc. rose the most since its public debut, closing Thursday at $107. The exchange is embroiled in a lawsuit of its own with the SEC that alleges that it sold tokens that are unregistered securities. “This underscores that direct sales of digital assets by an issuer will often be securities, but other sales, most notably sales on the secondary market, are unlikely to be deemed securities, which is a key argument in Coinbase’s defense against the SEC,” said Elliott Stein, Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst for litigation. MicroStrategy jumped 11.7% and crypto miner Marathon Digital closed more than 14% higher on the day. “My overall impression is this is a positive decision for the digital asset industry,” said Daniel Tramel Stabile, partner at Winston & Strawn. “The court expressly concluded that XRP is not, in and of itself, a security. Instead, the focus must be on the circumstances of the offering itself.” The SEC sued San Francisco-based Ripple and top executives in December 2020. At the time, the regulator accused the company, co-founder Christian Larsen and Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse of misleading investors in XRP by selling more than $1 billion worth of the tokens without registering them, depriving investors of information about the cryptocurrency and about Ripple’s business.     Even prior to the day’s enthusiastic price action, cryptocurrencies have been on a tear.  In recent weeks, a raft of filings for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, driven in large part by an application by Wall-Street heavyweight BlackRock Inc., has reinvigorated traders who’d been buffeted by the long crypto winter.  Bitcoin has risen around 90% in 2023, rebounding from a rout last year that was exacerbated by a string of industry scandals and bankruptcies, including that of Mashinsky’s Celsius. The token remains some way below its all-time high of almost $69,000 in 2021. Read:  Novogratz Sees Bitcoin Rising, Says ETFs Likely to Be Approved']\n",

      "['A rush by overseas buyers for Chinese gallium — a niche-but-critical metal that’s soon to be subject to export controls — has eased off as the pace of inquiries slows and local prices stabilize. Inquiries from foreign buyers have dissipated, researcher Shanghai Metals Market said in a note, citing market participants. Risks are rising as shipments may not able to leave before the curbs kick in next month, it said. China announced the restrictions on gallium as well as a second metal, germanium, earlier this month in a move seen as an escalation of the country’s tit-for-tat trade war on technology with the US and Europe. The two metals are crucial to parts of the semiconductor, telecommunications and electric-vehicle industries, and the curbs prompted US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to voice her concern during a recent visit to Beijing. After an initial gain, local gallium prices have steadied. The free-on-board price has been unchanged at $290 a kilogram for the past two days, according to Asian Metal Inc. That follows a 16% jump after the announcement of the restrictions, which require exporters to apply for licenses from the commerce ministry. Chinese prices may drop later this year as the curbs keep more supply at home, exacerbating a domestic surplus, according to SMM. China is the top producer of primary gallium, with capacity of over 800 tons a year, it said.  Global gallium prices have also steadied after a spike. This week, they’ve risen just 1.5% to $331 a kilogram, following a 27% surge last week as buyers rushed to lock in supply before the Chinese curbs start on Aug. 1.']\n",

      "['Luxury tycoon Francois-Henri Pinault is in advanced discussions to buy a majority stake in Creative Artists Agency, according to people familiar with the matter, potentially adding another international trophy asset to the portfolio of a French billionaire. The talent agency, backed by private equity firm TPG, could fetch a valuation of at least $7 billion, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the information isn’t public. The talks, which have come to light just as Hollywood writers and actors go on strike together for the first time in six decades, could still end without an agreement, one of the people said. If Pinault succeeds, the deal would show how French billionaires continue to broaden their reach beyond the businesses that made them wealthy in the first place. The Pinault family is the biggest shareholder in Kering SA, the owner of brands such as Gucci and Bottega Veneta. Via holding company Artemis, they also control a range of other prestigious assets such as auction house Christie’s and vineyards like Chateau Latour in Bordeaux. Rival Paris-based luxury firm LVMH, controlled by the world’s second-wealthiest person, Bernard Arnault, owns labels ranging from Louis Vuitton to Christian Dior to Dom Perignon. LVMH, the world’s largest fashion conglomerate, had already made inroads into the entertainment world by signing up Pharrell Williams as men’s creative director at Louis Vuitton, following collaborations with the likes of Rihanna.   Meanwhile, Patrick Drahi, founder of French telecoms company Altice, acquired auctioneer Sotheby’s in 2019.     Representatives for CAA and TPG declined to comment, while a representative for Pinault didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. CAA, founded by Michael Ovitz, Ron Meyer and several partners in 1975, has long been one of the premier power brokers in Hollywood, though the so-called superagents later left for new ventures.  The Los Angeles-based firm offers talent management services and packaged content for Hollywood studios. The firm’s site offers information on how to book Salma Hayek, Francois-Henri Pinault’s wife, as a speaker.  CAA, like its rivals WME and United Talent Agency, is backed with funds managed by a private equity firm.  In 2010, TPG acquired a 35% stake in CAA. Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, the asset manager in 2014 boosted its ownership share to 53% to take control of the business at a $1.1 billion valuation. TPG via CAA has made at least one major add-on deal since then. CAA agreed to buy a smaller companion agency in ICM Partners two years ago. A potential sale of CAA comes at a critical time for show business. The industry has been trying to adjust to quickly evolving streaming trends in a quest to reach profitability. It’s also facing a potentially crippling strike, with Screen Actors Guild picketing set to begin Friday in New York and Los Angeles, according to the union’s Twitter account. The guild, which represents some 160,000 performers, announced a walkout Thursday after failing to reach a new agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers, which represents studios including Walt Disney Co. and Netflix Inc.

      "['Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund boosted its holdings of Treasuries to a three-year high as the dollar’s strength against the yen offset losses on the securities. Resilient demand from GPIF, as the world’s biggest pension fund is known, suggests that elevated yields and a weak yen may support Japanese appetite for Treasuries, even if US interest rates are coming off recent highs as the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening campaign nears its peak.   GPIF holds ¥200 trillion ($1.4 trillion) worth of assets — a hoard about as big as Spain’s economy — and what it does has huge ramifications for Japanese portfolio flows, given that many of the nation’s other funds follow its lead. And investors from the Asia nation are the biggest foreign holders of Treasuries, with $1.1 trillion of the securities as of April. The fund increased US government bonds and bills to 43.3% of its foreign debt holdings in the 12 months through March from 40.8% previously, according to an analysis by Bloomberg of the latest data released this month. That’s the highest since the allocation reached 47.4% in March 2020, and also came despite currency-hedging costs hovering around the highest in more than two decades.  While easing inflation in the US means that Treasury yields may start to fall sooner than rates in other bond markets, they are likely to remain attractive to Japanese investors, according to Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “As long as the yen doesn’t strengthen, Japanese investors will benefit both from income and capital gains in Treasuries,” he said. Rebalancing flows resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates should continue to partly offset both depreciation and appreciation pressures on the yen, strategists at Barclays Plc, including Shinichiro Kadota, wrote in a research note. To be sure, the yen has rebounded recently and there are plausible scenarios that could extend the rally and affect flows into Treasuries: Signs of long-awaited inflationary pressure in Japan could trigger an earlier-than-expected shift in the Bank of Japan’s loose monetary policy, the Federal Reserve appears to be nearing the peak of its rate-hiking cycle, and global recession risks highlight the yen’s value as a haven.

GPIF’s holdings of US government bonds and bills increased 8.2% in yen terms to ¥21.6 trillion.  It should also be noted that GPIF’s asset allocation doesn’t directly reflect its market view. The fund outsources investment to managers such as BlackRock Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co., with 86% of foreign bonds passively invested to track benchmarks. GPIF’s assets are also equally divided into foreign and local equities as well as bonds.']\n",

      "['A top buyer of Russian oil is bracing for trading trouble as the price of Urals, the country’s main export grade, breaks through a $60-a-barrel cap set by Western nations to curb Moscow’s revenue. India and China have been the two dominant buyers of Russian crude since the invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago prompted others to shun the OPEC+ producer. As Urals climbs above the limit set by the Group of Seven, however, importers will face greater scrutiny on their purchases.  Officials from three Indian refiners said they are preparing for tougher talks with local banks involved in the financing of their Russian oil cargoes, including a lot more requests for evidence verifying the purchase price. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they’re not authorized to comment publicly. The price cap was designed to keep Russia oil flowing and prevent a global supply shock, while crimping the Kremlin’s revenue and its ability to fund the war in Ukraine. Importers are unable to use Western services such as insurance and shipping if crude is purchased above the $60-a-barrel limit. That’s led to the emergence of a large fleet of shadow tankers to bypass sanctions. Asian buyers regularly use this flotilla to import crude from Russian and other nations such as Iran. Officials from two Chinese refiners said their purchases of Russian oil over recent months have mostly been executed without the use of Western financial, insurance and shipping services. According to price reporting agency Argus Media, Urals topped $60 a barrel on Wednesday at its port of load on a free-on-board basis. For Asian buyers, there is still some consolation. While these assessments are widely referenced by oil traders across the world, they provide a good gauge but do not exactly predict purchase prices paid by buyers.  Most Russian cargoes bought by Asian refiners are on a delivered basis, which takes into account the price of crude at the loading port plus shipping and other miscellaneous costs and not on an FOB basis, which is used for the price cap. This delivered price is comprised of a formula that typically includes a privately-negotiated discount to the month-average of global benchmarks such as Brent or Dubai oil during the month of loading — which leave some room for maneuver when it comes to valuing the net-back cost of cargoes. One Indian official said his refinery’s purchases of Urals for loading in July could now be priced above the cap — depending on how Brent and other benchmarks perform for the remainder of this month. He said the company may need to consider the use of different currencies. Indian refiners have tested the use of other currencies such as dirhams, rubles and rupees for Russian crude cargoes. More recently, Russian sellers of crude to India have been increasingly interested in using yuan.  Disruptions to Russian crude flows to India could ripple across global oil markets, coinciding with reduced supply from Moscow and Riyadh and an expected tightening of the market. The South Asian nation currently imports almost half of its oil from Russia, with Urals making up the bulk of the barrels. Indian refiners may need to seek more cargoes from West Africa, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia or Iraq, should it see a major impact to its imports. Not all Russian oil deals in Asia will be altered as Urals is pushed higher. A huge chunk of Russia’s seaborne flows to China is comprised of ESPO Blend, a higher-quality grade typically priced above the $60 a barrel cap. Due to its consistently-high price, exports of the grade from ports in eastern Russia already rely on the shadow fleet and insurers willing to handle such trades.  Indian and Chinese refiners cautioned the final price for most Russian cargoes loading in July, for example, will only be known at the end of the month, leaving many to wait and see. One Indian official said buyers will focus on negotiating bigger discounts in order to reduce and bring the final FOB cost under $60 a barrel, should Brent or Dubai rise. The benchmarks make up the biggest pricing component.']\n",

      "['A federal court decision on a closely-watched crypto case involving Ripple Labs Inc. is taking Coinbase Global Inc. advocates back to a time when the potential for the largest US digital-asset exchange seemed almost limitless.  Shares of Coinbase rallied 24% on Thursday after the ruling was seen as potentially narrowing US Securities and Exchange Commission oversight when it comes to what can be listed on crypto trading platforms. The stock surge was the most since Coinbase jumped 31% at its debut on the Nasdaq in April 2021.  The rally is the latest in a recovery this year by Coinbase amid a rebound in Bitcoin’s price, despite its regulatory challenges from a lawsuit by the SEC, which alleged the platform was an unregistered securities exchange. Coinbase shares tumbled 86% last year. Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, XRP, Solana and Cardano, broadly rallied after the ruling.  “Coinbase is a secondary market exchange, and this type of opinion really calls into question whether the SEC’s approach with respect to secondary market exchanges make sense,” said Daniel Tramel Stabile, a partner at Winston & Strawn.    The ruling from the Ripple case should bode well for Coinbase, because it “undermines the SEC’s position that tokens sold on Coinbase’s platform were sales of unregistered securities,” said David Brill, former deputy general counsel of bankrupt crypto broker Voyager Digital.  Still, the decision from Ripple’s case is just one district court opinion and is not binding in other parts of the country, and the SEC could still appeal, said Stabile.  US District Judge Analisa Torres in New York ruled that the Ripple’s XRP token is a security when sold to institutional investors. But the judge said that didn’t apply to programmatic investors, meaning the broader public buying crypto on exchanges.  Whether cryptocurrencies are securities has been a major question hanging over the industry, which has long fought efforts to regulate it by arguing that they are not. The SEC sued Coinbase in June for the sale of unregistered securities. News of the Ripple ruling broke Thursday while a court hearing on the the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase in New York was ongoing. SEC lawyers sitting together in the courtroom gallery read the Ripple decision simultaneously, said Elliott Stein, a senior legal analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, who was at the courtroom.  US District Judge Katherine Polk Failla asked the SEC how someone would be able to determine whether a crypto token would be considered a security or not, and if such a distinction has been communicated properly to those operating in the crypto industry. The SEC responded by citing the Howey Test, a 1940s precedent laid down by the Supreme Court that is used for determining whether a transaction is considered an investment contract.  Meanwhile, Coinbase was quick to herald the Ripple decision. The exchange will relist XRP for trading after reviewing the court ruling, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, said in a tweet. “Although the judge’s order does not pertain to secondary transactions, which are out of scope of the Ripple lawsuit, the order affirms the view that the same crypto asset may be sold as both a security and a non-security, depending on the facts and circumstances,” said Michael Selig, counsel at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP Coinbase shares closed at $107 on Thursday, bringing the gains since December to more than 200%, helping to cushion the blow from last year’s decline.  When Coinbase first began to trade on Nasdaq in April 2021, the stock had climbed as high as $429. ']\n",

      "['A federal judge ruled that the Ripple Labs Inc. token is a security when sold to institutional investors but not the general public, a long-awaited decision that was widely hailed as a victory for the crypto industry over the SEC. US District Judge Analisa Torres in New York on Thursday said that the crypto firm’s sales of its XRP token to sophisticated investors met the test for an investment contract under federal securities law because those buyers “would have understood that Ripple was pitching a speculative value proposition for XRP with potential profits.” But the judge said that didn’t apply to programmatic investors, meaning the broader public buying crypto on exchanges. She said there was no evidence that such investors could parse the many statements made by Ripple about XRP. The judge said many statements cited by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its suit against Ripple may not have been shared with the broader public. XRP soared on the ruling, almost doubling to as much as 94 cents Thursday afternoon, with many industry figures and experts highlighting the judge’s ruling on secondary-market crypto sales as win. Whether cryptocurrencies are securities has long been a major question hanging over the industry, which has argued it’s not subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC and other regulators. Read More: Cryptos Jump as XRP Ruling Boosts Hope for Narrowed SEC Scope SEC spokesperson Scott Schneider said the agency is “pleased that the court found that XRP tokens were offered and sold by Ripple as investment contracts in violation of the securities laws.” The regulator was continuing its review of the decision, he said. Paul Kisslinger, a former SEC trial attorney now at Lewis Brisbois, said the ruling was a possible blow to the regulator’s jurisdiction because of most of the crypto community were likely retail investors, rather than hedge funds or other institutional investors.  “Judge Torres’s ruling, finding that XRP tokens are a security for institutional sales, but not for public sales, will have a propound impact on cases going forward,” Kissingler said. “If adopted by other courts, especially appellate courts, this will certainly narrow the SEC’s enforcement jurisdiction involving exchanges.” The ruling comes as the SEC has aggressively targeted crypto firms for allegedly selling unregistered securities. Earlier on Thursday, the SEC sued Celsius Network Ltd. and its former chief executive officer, Alex Mashinsky, who was also charged with fraud by federal prosecutors in New York. It came down in the middle of a conference in the case the SEC filed last month against crypotcurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc. Read More: Ex-Celsius CEO Mashinsky Charged in Latest DOJ Crypto Case David Brill, former deputy general counsel of bankrupt crypto broker Voyager Digital, said Torres’s ruling may be a “watershed moment for the classification of digital assets.” He said it boded particularly well for Coinbase. “It undermines the SEC’s position that tokens sold on Coinbase’s platform were sales of unregistered securities,” Brill said. The SEC sued San Francisco-based Ripple and top executives in December 2020. It accused the company, co-founder Christian Larsen and Chief Executive Officer Bradley Garlinghouse of misleading investors in XRP by selling more than $1 billion worth of the tokens without registering them, depriving investors of information about the cryptocurrency and Ripple’s business The SEC had argued for the application of the so-called Howey test, named after a 1946 Supreme Court ruling, to determine if XRP was a security. Torres applied the Howey test in finding institutional sales of the token fell under securities laws, which the SEC highlighted in its statement on Thursday. Read More: Fight to Regulate Crypto at Crossroads as Ripple Ruling Looms “The court agreed with the SEC that the Howey test governs the securities analysis of crypto transactions and rejected Ripple’s made-up test as to what constitutes an investment contract,” Schneider said. But Torres also used the Howey test to find XRP sold on exchanges weren’t securities. Under Howey, an investment contract — which would be considered a security — exists if there’s an “investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.” She said that didn’t apply to sales of XRP made through exchanges, which were often blind transaction made by trading algorithms.  “This could be a case of the SEC should be careful what it wished for,” said Jeff Blockinger, the former chief counsel for decentralized exchange Vertex Protocol, “meaning that the court agreed with them on a technical interpretation of Howey but also limited Howey’s application to everything under the sun.” Garlinghouse claimed victory in a tweet on Thursday. The SEC’s case against Ripple will still proceed on the institutional-sales claims, though any trial may be delayed by appeals of Torres’s ruling. The case is SEC v. Ripple Labs Inc., 20-cv-10832, US District Court, Southern District of New York.']\n",

      "['It’s been a brutal stretch for   crypto. Almost $2 trillion of market value in cryptocurrencies has been wiped away since the market peak in late 2021. Major digital asset companies have collapsed amid   allegations of fraud and market manipulation. US regulators are cracking down on many of the businesses still standing. But one corner of the market is suddenly garnering enthusiasm:   Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Some of the biggest and most established names on Wall Street are   filing or refiling applications with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in an attempt to be the first to release such a product. A Bitcoin ETF would invest in the cryptocurrency on behalf of its shareholders. In other words, investors could easily get direct exposure to crypto by going to their brokerage and buying shares the way they would a stock. BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest money manager,   applied for a Bitcoin ETF in mid-June, setting off a frenzy of filings from the likes of   Fidelity Investments,   Invesco and   WisdomTree. The   Nasdaq and   Cboe Global Markets exchange operators, which filed applications on behalf of BlackRock and Fidelity, respectively, have since   resubmitted the paperwork after the SEC said the initial filings were insufficient and lacked certain information. Pushback from the SEC is nothing new. Various fund companies have been trying for years to get crypto ETFs approved in the US, and they’ve consistently been rejected. So why the flurry of applications now, at a time when crypto has lost much of its former buzz? “Everybody is lining up at the starting gate, just waiting for the starting gun to go off” The timing coincides with a closely watched   lawsuit brought in federal court by   Grayscale Investments LLC against the SEC. The company runs the publicly traded   Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which holds Bitcoin the way a fund would but doesn’t have the ETF structure that allows it to keep its share price in line with the token’s price. It currently trades for about 28% less than the value of the Bitcoin it owns. Grayscale wants to be allowed to convert the trust to an ETF and is disputing the SEC’s reasoning in rejecting its application. A decision is expected as soon as this month. Oral arguments in the case in March sparked speculation that the court could clear the way for an ETF. Judges on an appellate panel in Washington grilled the SEC on its stance that Bitcoin ETFs shouldn’t be allowed because Bitcoin is more susceptible to fraud and manipulation than Bitcoin futures contracts. The SEC has already approved ETFs that invest in Bitcoin futures, which have been trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange since 2017. The judges questioned why the futures market and the direct spot market for Bitcoin would be so different when both rely on the same underlying asset pricing. “The industry sees the court case moving forward, and they realize there’s a nonzero probability that, like it or not, the SEC will be forced to allow a spot Bitcoin ETF,” says  James Angel, an associate finance professor at Georgetown University, who signed on to one of the amicus briefs in support of Grayscale. “When a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved, there’s going to be a competitive scramble to be the winner, and everybody is lining up at the starting gate, just waiting for the starting gun to go off.” Following the arguments, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts, who had predicted the SEC would prevail, adjusted their outlook to give Grayscale a 70% chance of winning. They also said that the wording of the ruling would be key. The court could tell the regulator to revisit its reasoning, giving it an opening to deny Grayscale’s application on different grounds. The SEC could also appeal a decision in Grayscale’s favor, further delaying any approval. A Bitcoin ETF would not only open the door for more retail investors to trade crypto, it could also offer a more appealing avenue for wealth advisers investing on behalf of their clients or institutional participants; they’d be more comfortable placing money into a product with which they’re familiar. Exchange-traded funds are a huge business. BlackRock managed about $3 trillion in client assets in ETFs at the end of March, invested in an array of assets including stocks, bonds and commodities.  Salim Ramji, global head of BlackRock’s ETF and index investing business,   told Bloomberg Television that the company’s interest in crypto is a logical extension of its model: “How do we help investors gain access to parts of the market that had otherwise been more difficult or really expensive or opaque?” Chief Executive Officer  Larry Fink seems to have had a turnaround on Bitcoin. About six years ago, he said cryptocurrencies were a proxy for how much money laundering was in the world. But he recently told Fox Business that Bitcoin is an “international asset” akin to “digitizing gold.” Over the past year, BlackRock has expanded into crypto, working with   Coinbase Global Inc. to make it easier for institutional investors to manage and trade Bitcoin and setting up a private Bitcoin trust. According to filings, Coinbase would be in charge of safekeeping the Bitcoin in the BlackRock ETF and helping to keep tabs on market integrity. Coinbase is the largest US crypto exchange, which gives it visibility into American trading activity. But it’s also been a target of regulators. In June the   SEC sued Coinbase for listing tokens the agency considers unregistered securities. Coinbase says nothing it lists meets the definition of a security and is   fighting the suit. A Fidelity representative says “a meaningful portion” of its customers already own or are interested in crypto. The company found in a survey last year that a Bitcoin ETF is the most appealing idea in the US for a new digital asset product, and that more than three-quarters of high-net-worth investors, family offices and financial advisers want to buy digital assets. But some things many institutional investors have said they like about crypto—such as diversification and inflation hedging—are looking shakier these days. Bitcoin prices tumbled last year right along with tech stocks and the broader market, amid the highest inflation seen in decades. Cryptocurrencies are volatile: Bitcoin skyrocketed 305% in 2020 and 60% in 2021 before plunging 64% in 2022. In recent remarks to reporters in the wake of the applications, SEC Chair  Gary Gensler said investors in crypto couldn’t be as confident in the fairness and integrity of the market as they could be with US stocks. Crypto remains largely unregulated, as investors learned when a string of high-profile companies imploded last year, costing some their life savings while setting off a contagion in crypto markets. “It’s an incredible danger for consumers,” says   John Reed Stark, a former SEC enforcement attorney who now runs his own consulting company. “Whenever these entities like Fidelity and others start transacting in crypto, it just adds a level of legitimacy that is not warranted because the space is so rife with manipulation and fraud.” For now, the finance industry’s heavy hitters are waiting on judges and the SEC to rule on whether the ETFs can go forward. The process could take months. But Bitcoin traders appear to like the odds and are welcoming Wall Street’s advances: The price has jumped more than 20% since the day before BlackRock’s filing. —With  Lydia BeyoudRead next: Brew Another Pot, Robinhood’s 24-Hour Stock Trading Is Here']\n",

      "['A rush by overseas buyers for Chinese gallium — a niche-but-critical metal that’s soon to be subject to export controls — has eased off as the pace of inquiries slows and local prices stabilize. Inquiries from foreign buyers have dissipated, researcher Shanghai Metals Market said in a note, citing market participants. Risks are rising as shipments may not able to leave before the curbs kick in next month, it said. China announced the restrictions on gallium as well as a second metal, germanium, earlier this month in a move seen as an escalation of the country’s tit-for-tat trade war on technology with the US and Europe. The two metals are crucial to parts of the semiconductor, telecommunications and electric-vehicle industries, and the curbs prompted US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to voice her concern during a recent visit to Beijing. After an initial gain, local gallium prices have steadied. The free-on-board price has been unchanged at $290 a kilogram for the past two days, according to Asian Metal Inc. That follows a 16% jump after the announcement of the restrictions, which require exporters to apply for licenses from the commerce ministry. Chinese prices may drop later this year as the curbs keep more supply at home, exacerbating a domestic surplus, according to SMM. China is the top producer of primary gallium, with capacity of over 800 tons a year, it said.  Global gallium prices have also steadied after a spike. This week, they’ve risen just 1.5% to $331 a kilogram, following a 27% surge last week as buyers rushed to lock in supply before the Chinese curbs start on Aug. 1.']\n",

      "['Luxury tycoon Francois-Henri Pinault is in advanced discussions to buy a majority stake in Creative Artists Agency, according to people familiar with the matter, potentially adding another international trophy asset to the portfolio of a French billionaire. The talent agency, backed by private equity firm TPG, could fetch a valuation of at least $7 billion, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the information isn’t public. The talks, which have come to light just as Hollywood writers and actors go on strike together for the first time in six decades, could still end without an agreement, one of the people said. If Pinault succeeds, the deal would show how French billionaires continue to broaden their reach beyond the businesses that made them wealthy in the first place. The Pinault family is the biggest shareholder in Kering SA, the owner of brands such as Gucci and Bottega Veneta. Via holding company Artemis, they also control a range of other prestigious assets such as auction house Christie’s and vineyards like Chateau Latour in Bordeaux. Rival Paris-based luxury firm LVMH, controlled by the world’s second-wealthiest person, Bernard Arnault, owns labels ranging from Louis Vuitton to Christian Dior to Dom Perignon. LVMH, the world’s largest fashion conglomerate, had already made inroads into the entertainment world by signing up Pharrell Williams as men’s creative director at Louis Vuitton, following collaborations with the likes of Rihanna.   Meanwhile, Patrick Drahi, founder of French telecoms company Altice, acquired auctioneer Sotheby’s in 2019.     Representatives for CAA and TPG declined to comment, while a representative for Pinault didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. CAA, founded by Michael Ovitz, Ron Meyer and several partners in 1975, has long been one of the premier power brokers in Hollywood, though the so-called superagents later left for new ventures.  The Los Angeles-based firm offers talent management services and packaged content for Hollywood studios. The firm’s site offers information on how to book Salma Hayek, Francois-Henri Pinault’s wife, as a speaker.  CAA, like its rivals WME and United Talent Agency, is backed with funds managed by a private equity firm.  In 2010, TPG acquired a 35% stake in CAA. Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, the asset manager in 2014 boosted its ownership share to 53% to take control of the business at a $1.1 billion valuation. TPG via CAA has made at least one major add-on deal since then. CAA agreed to buy a smaller companion agency in ICM Partners two years ago. A potential sale of CAA comes at a critical time for show business. The industry has been trying to adjust to quickly evolving streaming trends in a quest to reach profitability. It’s also facing a potentially crippling strike, with Screen Actors Guild picketing set to begin Friday in New York and Los Angeles, according to the union’s Twitter account. The guild, which represents some 160,000 performers, announced a walkout Thursday after failing to reach a new agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers, which represents studios including Walt Disney Co. and Netflix Inc.

      "['Behind India’s record-setting growth lies a glaring caveat: The world’s most populous country has a serious data problem. For years, the South Asian nation has relied on outdated surveys to quantify everything from gross domestic product to inflation. Most of India’s economic data is based on numbers collected more than a decade ago, when smartphones were rare and apps like Uber or Zomato hadn’t yet revolutionized the way Indians travel, eat and shop. This means the consumer price index — which is used by the central bank to set borrowing costs — doesn’t fully capture the texture of modern India. The statistics ministry still collects sales data for near-obsolete items like audio cassettes, making it difficult for market watchers to measure the true strength of the world’s fifth-largest economy and form a nuanced picture about its demographics and consumption habits. “We have programs for people below the poverty line, but we don’t know the number of poor people,” said Pronab Sen, India’s former chief statistician. It’s an alarming problem for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who’s pitching India as the next big market for global investment and trade. Economists warn that the risk of policy errors will rise unless India moves quickly to update figures and remove barriers to accessing reliable data. “Our ability to track inflation effectively has been severely undermined,” Modi’s economic advisor Bibek Debroy and his colleague Aditya Sinha wroteBloomberg Terminal in a column for The Hindu this week. “Our tools for understanding and managing our economic reality are grossly inadequate.” Take the case of India’s services sector. The segment is now responsible for roughly half of a household’s spending, though it holds a 24% weight in India’s CPI, which hasn’t been updated since 2012. In another example, Indians spend less than 30% on food, though that metric comprises about half of the CPI basket. “What we cannot measure we cannot manage,” Chief Statistician G.P. Samanta said at an event last month, where he vowed to “create an ecosystem where data guides policymakers on the path of sustainable development.” After years of delays, the government started a new consumer expenditure survey in 2022, which captures consumption patterns in India and will help in policy formation. But the survey won’t feed into GDP or CPI metrics for at least two years, forcing analysts to use alternative indicators like air traffic and fuel demand to check the pulse of India’s economy.  To more accurately estimate GDP, the government has also made a list of 200 critical data sources, according to people familiar with the matter. The list includes goods and services tax collections, company filings and e-way bills for interstate movement of goods. India’s statistics ministry is pressing other government departments to share information in a timely manner to reduce lags in data reporting, the people said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private. The statistics ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment. The issue is not limited to outdated numbers. Frequent revisions to existing data have added Bloomberg Terminalto frustrations, making it difficult to predict where one of the world’s fastest-growing economies is headed — and raising accusations among India’s political opposition that the numbers have been tampered with. Data revisions in recent years made India’s growth appear impressive during a devastating cash ban. During a later revision, economic contraction from the pandemic narrowed, making the country’s recovery appear bouncier. Kunal Kundu, a Societe Generale GSC Pvt. economist, said forecasting growth in India is a “hazardous task,” partly because the numbers are so elastic. Gross domestic product for last quarter surprised many when it came in one percentage point higher than estimates. “The reason everybody got this wrong is the alarming regularity with which the data is getting revised,” he said. Officials now avoid leaning too heavily on the government’s own figures. For instance, rather than use “bad data,” economists at the Reserve Bank of India are likely using a combination of intuition and inflation numbers to set interest rates, according to Sen. “Monetary policymakers supplement official estimates with information on auxiliary variables to have a firmer assessment and minimize policy errors emanating from data revision,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in June. India’s data collection problem has several roots. A staff shortage in the statistics ministry has slowed progress on the consumer expenditure survey, as well as conducting a new nationwide census, which hasn’t been updated since 2011. The number of field investigators has also broadly remained stagnant since the 1970s, though India’s population has grown by several hundred million people. Today, loosely trained contractors are responsible for collecting the bulk of demographic information across India. With national elections less than a year away, few analysts believe Modi’s administration will release sensitive data ahead of voting, particularly around issues like employment. The infusion of politics into data-collection has frustrated many of India’s top statisticians, who’ve emphasized that the nation can’t reach its growth goals if nobody knows what’s happening on the ground. “There is a credibility crisis,” said P.C. Mohanan, the former head of India’s National Statistical Commission, who resigned in 2019 to protest the government’s decision to withhold a jobs report.  “In the absence of real and credible data, people will go for all kinds of interpretation and that is a problem,” he said. “Who knows what the right picture is, because there is no survey.”']\n",

Crude remains marginally lower this year and the International Energy Agency said Thursday that global demand won’t grow as fast as previously expected in 2023, although the agency still sees record demand. The market is expected to tighten in the second half, aided by supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries expects an even tighter global oil market next year, a view more bullish than other forecasters. World oil consumption will climb by 2.2 million barrels a day to reach 104.3 million a day, OPEC said on Thursday in its first detailed assessment of 2024. Crude prices have “some room to run, with the oil balance looking increasingly tight for the remainder of the year,” said Warren Patterson, the Singapore-based head of commodities strategy at ING Groep NV. “However, from a technical point of view, the market is likely to face some strong resistance at the 200-day moving average.” To get Bloomberg’s Energy Daily newsletter direct into your inbox, click here.

      "['Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund boosted its holdings of Treasuries to a three-year high as the dollar’s strength against the yen offset losses on the securities. Resilient demand from GPIF, as the world’s biggest pension fund is known, suggests that elevated yields and a weak yen may support Japanese appetite for Treasuries, even if US interest rates are coming off recent highs as the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening campaign nears its peak.   GPIF holds ¥200 trillion ($1.4 trillion) worth of assets — a hoard about as big as Spain’s economy — and what it does has huge ramifications for Japanese portfolio flows, given that many of the nation’s other funds follow its lead. And investors from the Asia nation are the biggest foreign holders of Treasuries, with $1.1 trillion of the securities as of April. The fund increased US government bonds and bills to 43.3% of its foreign debt holdings in the 12 months through March from 40.8% previously, according to an analysis by Bloomberg of the latest data released this month. That’s the highest since the allocation reached 47.4% in March 2020, and also came despite currency-hedging costs hovering around the highest in more than two decades.  While easing inflation in the US means that Treasury yields may start to fall sooner than rates in other bond markets, they are likely to remain attractive to Japanese investors, according to Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “As long as the yen doesn’t strengthen, Japanese investors will benefit both from income and capital gains in Treasuries,” he said. Rebalancing flows resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates should continue to partly offset both depreciation and appreciation pressures on the yen, strategists at Barclays Plc, including Shinichiro Kadota, wrote in a research note. To be sure, the yen has rebounded recently and there are plausible scenarios that could extend the rally and affect flows into Treasuries: Signs of long-awaited inflationary pressure in Japan could trigger an earlier-than-expected shift in the Bank of Japan’s loose monetary policy, the Federal Reserve appears to be nearing the peak of its rate-hiking cycle, and global recession risks highlight the yen’s value as a haven.   Top China Fund With 75% Return Bets on AI Stocks for Recovery Record Cash Inflows Have India Funds Halting New Subscriptions Sino-Ocean Bondholders Yet to Receive Dollar Coupon Due Thursday In the 12 month’s in question though, the dollar jumped 9.2% against Japan’s currency while Treasuries lost 4.5%. GPIF’s holdings of US government bonds and bills increased 8.2% in yen terms to ¥21.6 trillion.  It should also be noted that GPIF’s asset allocation doesn’t directly reflect its market view. The fund outsources investment to managers such as BlackRock Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co., with 86% of foreign bonds passively invested to track benchmarks. GPIF’s assets are also equally divided into foreign and local equities as well as bonds.']\n",

      "['A top buyer of Russian oil is bracing for trading trouble as the price of Urals, the country’s main export grade, breaks through a $60-a-barrel cap set by Western nations to curb Moscow’s revenue. India and China have been the two dominant buyers of Russian crude since the invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago prompted others to shun the OPEC+ producer. As Urals climbs above the limit set by the Group of Seven, however, importers will face greater scrutiny on their purchases.  Officials from three Indian refiners said they are preparing for tougher talks with local banks involved in the financing of their Russian oil cargoes, including a lot more requests for evidence verifying the purchase price. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they’re not authorized to comment publicly. The price cap was designed to keep Russia oil flowing and prevent a global supply shock, while crimping the Kremlin’s revenue and its ability to fund the war in Ukraine. Importers are unable to use Western services such as insurance and shipping if crude is purchased above the $60-a-barrel limit. That’s led to the emergence of a large fleet of shadow tankers to bypass sanctions. Asian buyers regularly use this flotilla to import crude from Russian and other nations such as Iran. Officials from two Chinese refiners said their purchases of Russian oil over recent months have mostly been executed without the use of Western financial, insurance and shipping services. According to price reporting agency Argus Media, Urals topped $60 a barrel on Wednesday at its port of load on a free-on-board basis. For Asian buyers, there is still some consolation. While these assessments are widely referenced by oil traders across the world, they provide a good gauge but do not exactly predict purchase prices paid by buyers.  Most Russian cargoes bought by Asian refiners are on a delivered basis, which takes into account the price of crude at the loading port plus shipping and other miscellaneous costs and not on an FOB basis, which is used for the price cap. This delivered price is comprised of a formula that typically includes a privately-negotiated discount to the month-average of global benchmarks such as Brent or Dubai oil during the month of loading — which leave some room for maneuver when it comes to valuing the net-back cost of cargoes. One Indian official said his refinery’s purchases of Urals for loading in July could now be priced above the cap — depending on how Brent and other benchmarks perform for the remainder of this month. He said the company may need to consider the use of different currencies. Indian refiners have tested the use of other currencies such as dirhams, rubles and rupees for Russian crude cargoes. More recently, Russian sellers of crude to India have been increasingly interested in using yuan.  Disruptions to Russian crude flows to India could ripple across global oil markets, coinciding with reduced supply from Moscow and Riyadh and an expected tightening of the market. The South Asian nation currently imports almost half of its oil from Russia, with Urals making up the bulk of the barrels. Indian refiners may need to seek more cargoes from West Africa, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia or Iraq, should it see a major impact to its imports. Not all Russian oil deals in Asia will be altered as Urals is pushed higher. A huge chunk of Russia’s seaborne flows to China is comprised of ESPO Blend, a higher-quality grade typically priced above the $60 a barrel cap. Due to its consistently-high price, exports of the grade from ports in eastern Russia already rely on the shadow fleet and insurers willing to handle such trades.  Indian and Chinese refiners cautioned the final price for most Russian cargoes loading in July, for example, will only be known at the end of the month, leaving many to wait and see. One Indian official said buyers will focus on negotiating bigger discounts in order to reduce and bring the final FOB cost under $60 a barrel, should Brent or Dubai rise. The benchmarks make up the biggest pricing component.']\n",

      "['For Stephen Jen, the famous dollar prognosticator, the Federal Reserve looks all set to win its war on inflation without tipping the US economy into a nasty recession.  That’s bad news for the world’s reserve currency and threatens to send shockwaves across foreign-exchange markets.  As expectations mount for a so-called soft landing in the US, the chief executive of London-based asset manager Eurizon SLJ Capital is once again touting the merits of his dollar-smile worldview. As the influential theory goes, the greenback typically gains when the US economy is either in a deep slump or a strong expansion — and lags in times of moderate growth, like now. The evidence for the latter scenario, Jen says, is already forming as the dollar sinks to its lowest in more than a year, with traders betting consumer prices have peaked in the aftermath of the Fed’s aggressive policy tightening.  That downtrend is set to continue with public debt burdens and economic imbalances weighing on growth, according to Jen, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund. “The dollar has been, and still is, very overvalued. It won’t take much for the dollar to converge back to their fair value,” he said in an interview.  “I think the Fed will do one more rate hike and a soft landing can be achieved.” This week has already made clear how quickly a slump in the greenback can rip across global financial markets, as a promising report on the US inflation trajectory spurred currency rallies from Sweden and Japan to South Africa and Peru. To Jen, the euro is primed to offer a fresh example of that momentum with a sprint to $1.20 within the next six months, a nearly 7% increase from current levels.    “Once the FOMC collective view on inflation is modified — which I think it will be soon — the dollar will weaken at at a much faster pace,” he said. “The dollar will no longer have a cyclical support.” While a July rate increase is still all but assured, the rapid descent in price growth — now just a third of its 2022 peak rate — has offered fresh hope that the Fed can soon end its tightening cycle. Traders now see less than a 50% chance that the Fed opts for additional interest-rate increases after July.  All that, according to Jen, means investors will then have to wrestle with macro headwinds other than inflation or a potential recession: deficits. As the US has ramped up spending, public debt has increased to 118% of gross-domestic product from just 54% in 2000, according to St. Louis Fed data.  The nation’s current-account deficit, a shortfall between savings and investments, keeps worsening. And this means the US has built up a large net liability to the rest of the world, making — at least in theory — its currency vulnerable to a selloff in the event foreign investors dump dollar assets.  The theory finds some support from Paresh Upadhyaya, director of currency strategy at Amundi Asset Management. “If you’re not seeing that flight to quality coming into Treasuries, how do you finance those deficits?” he said. “The dollar will have to depreciate to levels that are attractive enough to attract investors.” The US economy slowing without plunging into a deep recession “is the worst case scenario as far as the dollar is concerned, because the risk trade is OK,” Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at Deutsche Bank, said on Bloomberg Television. “Bonds like it. Equities like it. The dollar really does not like that scenario.” Bloomberg’s dollar gauge has fallen nearly 4% this year.  Strategists have already begun to coalesce around Europe’s common currency as a big beneficiary. Deutsche Bank is targeting the common currency at $1.15 by year’s end, while Nomura Holdings Inc.’s forecasters see it hitting $1.14 by the end of September. Hedge funds are starting to embrace the trade with net longs among leveraged funds back at June highs, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. “This ‘neither hot nor cold’ economic scenario will allow investors to focus on the incredible structural weaknesses of the US and that should be negative for the dollar,” said Jen.']\n",

      "['The most important takeaway from next week’s gathering of finance chiefs from the world’s biggest developed and emerging economies won’t be on the official agenda: who’s gaining in the battle for global influence between the US and its allies on one side and China and Russia on the other. Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors convene in Gandhinagar, the capital of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state Gujarat, in coming days, with key meetings set for July 17-18. Policymakers aim for progress on bolstering the resources of multilateral development banks, encouraging greater flows of credit to limit climate change and executing on a global corporate-tax deal that’s proven tough to finish. Several top officials, including the German and UK finance heads and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, are expected to skip the meeting — which is sandwiched between last month’s global finance summit in Paris and the G-20 leaders’ conclave in September — a move that will lend importance to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s attendance. She’ll be making her third visit to India in nine months, amid a concerted US push to strengthen ties with China’s giant neighbor. India, the rotating head of the G-20 this year, was unable at the last finance meeting in April to secure either a joint statement or even a chair’s statement of summary, underscoring deep divisions in a group that includes Russia. In February, the chair’s statement had reiterated G-20 language from last year pointing out that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had led to a United Nations vote of condemnation. But things have evolved: Yellen has just re-established high-level economic engagement with China, and Modi recently delivered an historic second address to the US Congress, with a Bastille Day-welcome in Paris looming for him on Friday. Russia, meantime, saw internal dissent on public display last month with the Wagner Group incident. “Whether China is going to shift” its stance on G-20 statement language with regard to Russia will be key to watch, said John Kirton, director for the G-20 Research Group at the University of Toronto. “Maybe Russia just has less influence in vetoing all of the problematic passages.” The G-20 members have also been deadlocked on debt relief for developing nations, after conceiving a coordinated plan known as the Common Framework in 2020. While the US and allies have pressed China, by far the largest official creditor to poorer countries, to step up, Beijing has urged multilateral lenders such as the World bank to participate in taking haircuts. China, represented by Premier Li Qiang, helped the French hosts make the Paris financial summit a success by participating in a long-awaited agreement in principle to restructure Zambia’s debt. No such breakthroughs are anticipated in the coming days, in part thanks to the absence of the highly indebted nations needing relief, but further discussion alone may be a good sign. “We still are in this world where the Common Framework is not living up to its potential, but it is making progress,” said Stephanie Segal, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. Another issue to monitor for progress will be talks to overhaul the World Bank and other large multilateral lenders. Yellen has been among those pressing for those banks to work harder to incentivize private capital flows toward developing nations. She’s also urged them to take a bigger role in combating climate change. The US estimates that these lenders — as a system — could unlock as much as $200 billion over the next 10 years by implementing change, a senior Treasury official said Thursday.  Divisions have emerged over the extent to which aid to the poorest nations, who qualify for so-called concessional financing, ought to be prioritized, risking diminished credit for lower-middle income economies. The G-20 are also slated to touch base on an initiative to revamp global corporate taxes. While most of the world agreed in 2021 on a two-pillar deal to end a so-called race to the bottom on business levies, getting it finalized has been a challenge. Read More: US Wins Conditional Digital-Tax Truce as Global Deal Advances “It’s a very crowded agenda,” and it’s unlikely there’ll be major developments on any particular front, Segal said. Ahead of the full G-20, the Group of Seven industrialized nations meets on Sunday, where the finance chiefs are expected to focus on support for Ukraine, the reform of multilateral development banks and the G-7’s push to recalibrate global supply chains. Boosting support for Ukraine is also on the agenda. Gandhinagar will be the debut outing to a G-20 finance chiefs gathering for newly installed World Bank President Ajay Banga. It also offers Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek and central bank Governor Hafize Gaye Erkan the opportunity to attend for the first time since President Recep Tayyip Erdogan unveiled his post-election economic team.  Finance ministries and central banks not sending their principal policymakers typically are represented by other senior officials. For Yellen, the trip offers another chance to deepen ties with India, a location she’s singled out for “friend-shoring” supply chains. A senior Treasury official said the India relationship was one of the three reasons for Yellen’s attendance at Gandhinagar, alongside multilateral development bank reform and debt relief. Read More: Yellen Heads to G-20 for Third Visit to Friend-Shoring Pal India The G-20 was set up in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, and was hailed during the global financial meltdown in 2008 for helping to limit the damage of that economic disaster. In more recent years, a slew of alternative groupings has gained attention, including the BRICS forum for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, which is scheduled for a summit next month. “The Biden administration has used these forums to reinforce and demonstrate the power of unity of like-minded countries — developed economies/democracies — to continue assert the US views and influence,” said Philippe Dauba-Pantanacce, an economist and global geopolitical strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Paris, of the G-20. “There is a competition on who will influence the next global order, and how.”']\n",

      "['The yuan is rebounding from its latest bout of weakness, as China moves to protect economic growth and a historic US monetary tightening campaign nears an end. The Chinese currency is set to advance for a second straight week, after sinking more than 5% last quarter against the dollar. Forecasters including UBS Group AG, BNP Paribas SA and others predict that the yuan will rally toward 7 per dollar, or strengthen even more, by the end of this year from 7.17 now. Optimism about the yuan is gaining traction as expectations grow that Beijing won’t tolerate another slump in the world’s second-largest economy, given the rising threat of financial instability and high youth unemployment. Meantime, softening US inflation has raised the prospect for the Federal Reserve to wrap up its rate-hike cycle, pressuring the dollar and easing the risk of capital flight from China.   “The yuan will be more resilient in the second half of the year post the rapid depreciation in the last two months,” said Cary Yeung, head of Greater China debt at Pictet Asset Management. “The negativity has been priced in, and despite recent challenges, we still believe the recovery has legs with support from both monetary and fiscal sides.” The People’s Bank of China has stepped up efforts to prop up its currency in recent weeks. The central bank used the daily reference exchange rate to guide the yuan stronger and warned against speculation.  “While the the yuan’s exchange rate is mostly decided by the market, we still need to make sure that both the hands of the market and the government can work better together, so we can avoid resolutely avoid big swings,” the central bank’s deputy governor Liu Guoqiang said at a presser Friday. Authorities also have moved to revive broader confidence in China’s economy and markets, extending support for an ailing property sector and mulling fresh plans to defuse debt risks among local governments. At the same time, signs are growing that Beijing is done with a years-long crackdown on the country’s tech firms, removing a major regulatory overhang for investors.   While a housing crisis persists and exports stay weak, green shoots are emerging in the economy after a series of interest rate cuts, such as the rapid credit expansion last month.   “This round of yuan’s depreciation has reached the late stage as dollar yields are expected to come lower,” said Ju Wang, head of Greater China FX and rates strategy at BNP Paribas. The yuan is expected to stay in a range of 7.1-7.4 per dollar in the current quarter, before strengthening toward 6.95 at the year end, Wang added.  The offshore yuan advanced for a seventh straight session to 7.1321. It’s set for a weekly gain of 1.4%, which is the largest since January. The onshore yuan also rose 0.3%.  The US interest premium will remain, but the impact on the yuan will be contained if China refrains from unduly sizable rate cuts and expectations for a Fed policy pivot grow, said Yifan Hu, chief investment officer for Asia Pacific at UBS Wealth Management. Hu’s team expects the dollar-yuan pair to drop to 6.9 by the year’s end.  In a sign of easing pressure on the yuan, Chinese banks reportedlyBloomberg Terminal posted significantly higher foreign-currency sales by clients last month. Meantime, outflows from Chinese domestic bonds has moderatedBloomberg Terminal, following a record exodus last year. The PBOC’s composure when its currency was under siege earlier this year also helped steady nerves. It has so far refrained from deploying more aggressive weapons against short-sellers, such as releasing low-cost dollar liquidity or making bearish bets more expensive. Reflecting the relative calm, the implied volatility for the dollar-yuan pair has stayed well below levels seen last year and the gap between the offshore and onshore yuan remains narrow. The dollar-yuan rate has probably peaked after the PBOC signaled discomfort with the pace of currency depreciation via its “light-touch” approach to using the fixing to guide the yuan stronger, said Desmond Soon, head of Asia ex-Japan investment management and a fund manager at Western Asset Management Co.']\n",

      "['Global carry traders are facing a growing sense of anxiety toward anything that threatens to derail one of 2023’s hottest investments. From the risk of a hawkish Bank of Japan policy shift that may revalueBloomberg Terminal popular funding currency the yen, to a signal in bond markets that the Federal Reserve will hike the US economy into recession, concern is growing among investors that the beneficial low-volatility FX environment may be on its last legs. A return of large swings is often fatal to the strategy of borrowing where interest rates are low and investing in higher-yield, often emerging market currencies. Strategists from the likes of Deutsche Bank AG and DBS Bank Ltd. are mulling risks that may upend a trade which by one average gauge gained 5% in the first half but depending on the currency pairs used had the potential to return about 40%, according to a measure compiled by Bloomberg.  For DBS strategist Chang Wei Liang, a reversal in the inflation narrative is one such risk, as it is leading to a pickup in currency volatility.  “The Fed is now almost done with rate hikes as inflation pressures abate, while in Japan, inflation is showing signs of life and could trigger a BOJ policy tweak,” Chang said Thursday. “Carry trades, such as being long dollar-yen, are prone to be toppled over if commonly assumed policy trends unexpectedly reverse.”   A surge in the Japanese currency this week has been linkedBloomberg Terminal to profit-taking in carry and some hedging against the possibility the BOJ will tweak policy this month in the face of growing inflationary pressures. The yen rose for a seventh straight day on Friday.  “Combined with an uptick in volatility in rates markets and some dent in broader risk sentiment, the carry trade is getting carted away,” wrote Jefferies strategist Brad Bechtel. DBS isn’t alone in thinking of triggers. Deutsche Bank sees a big spike in VIX, the volatility gauge for US stocks, as one of the most likely catalysts for a sustained unwind in the FX carry trade. That could happen if the equity market’s expectation of a so-called soft landing scenario is challenged. “Slowing economic growth as mirrored in the recent decline in the US PMI should be pushing FX volatility higher,” strategists including Rohini Grover wrote in a recent note. “But, the very depressed level of equity volatility is offsetting this deterioration keeping FX volatility contained.”  Mahjabeen Zaman, head of FX research at ANZ, is worried about a slowdown in economic activity impinging on dollar-yen. That could occur if easier monetary policy returns to the US, bringing down the gap between US and Japanese interest rates which so heavily weighed on the yen this cycle.  “The long USD/JPY, one of the most prominent carry trades, could see substantial unwinding once rate differentials are no longer the focus,” she said in an interview this month.  Growth doesn’t even need to slow for the carry trade to come a cropper. Alvaro Vivanco, head of EM and ESG macro strategy at Natwest, has shifted his view on emerging-market carry trades to a more neutral stance on the continued strong performance of the US jobs market and its impact on price pressures there. “Simply put, given the much better performance of emerging market inflation, we think that carry has peaked in most high-beta currencies,” Vivanco wrote. “This could reverse the positive, and at times very strong, momentum for EM.” Of course not everyone is betting on an across-the-board imminent unwinding of the carry trade. For one thing, top money managers are bearish on the dollar, which has defied predictions of a prolonged slump since at least the beginning of the year. And while levels are becoming less attractive, the currencies of countries with strong reserves, balance of payments and prudent central banks are still appealing, according to Esther Law, senior investment manager for emerging-markets debt at Amundi SA in London. “The Mexican peso is one I think can withstand an unwind well,” Law said. “Countries where the central banks can support the currency should also stand well such as India.” The Colombian peso, Brazilian real and South African rand are “decently positioned” given their more favorable valuations, “but it may still be a bumpy ride with divergent monetary policies between emerging and developed markets,” said Carlos de Sousa, emerging markets debt portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich. On a geographic basis, Asia is most likely to offer shelter, Amundi’s Law said in an interview last week. “I expect APAC to be less affected than Latam and EMEA at times of carry trades unwind as most of the crowded positioning and high yield currencies are concentrated in Latin America,” she said.']\n",

      "[\" Due to a combination of drought, climate change and booming growth, Arizona is facing looming water scarcity. But for all the sprawl and population increase, the overwhelming amount of water used in the state is not consumed by residences, but rather farmers. So naturally, many argue that we should be doing less agriculture in the desert and move the production of cotton, alfalfa and various vegetables towards places with more rain. On this episode, we speak with Trevor Bales, the proprietor of Bales Hay Farm & Ranch in Arizona about his family’s history in the state and why he thinks this dry desert is a great place to grow alfalfa.

Why are we farming a bunch of water intensive stuff in the desert? Joe (01:40):Yeah, right. This is how it goes in people's head. They're booming in Arizona, there's water scarcity. And then they discover that Arizona, despite being the desert, 75% of the water used in Arizona is agriculture. And they go, ‘What?! That's crazy. Why are we growing food or growing grains or crops in the desert?’ And then people say, 'oh, well that's the problem.' We just need to stop growing in the desert. And the conversation ends there. But obviously all of these things are like way more complicated than like the five seconds it takes you to reach that conclusion. Tracy (02:12):I'm very curious how this became a thing. Like how did agriculture become a big part of the Arizona economy and why in particular does it seem like we are farming water intensive crops in an area where water nowadays seems to be a concern? And maybe that's the key. It didn't used to be as much of a concern and now it is. But I am very interested in hearing this side of the story. Joe (02:36):I think they've always sort of wondered like, 'What's the deal with agriculture in the middle of the desert?' Anyway, we literally have the perfect guest because as you mentioned, it's been going on for a long time. We have the perfect guest. We are going to be speaking with Trevor Bales. He is a sixth-generation farmer in Arizona. He runs Bales Hay Farm and Ganch, which grows alfalfa. He's based in Buckeye, Arizona in the southwest part of the state. We're going to talk all about the history, the operations, the water usage, all of these things about growing alfalfa in the desert. So, Trevor, thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots. Trevor Bales (03:11):Hi guys. Great to be here. Joe (03:13):Can I ask you a really obnoxious question? Trevor (03:13):Yeah! Joe (03:15):Just to start. Bales...people are going to be like 'your guest is made up.' Tracy (03:20):Nominative determinism Joe (03:22):The alfalfa farmer in Arizona's last name is Bales. Like you cannot be real. Trevor (03:26):We did not. No, we did not change her name. It's been Bales. Before it was Bales of alfalfa. It was Bales of cotton. So still a Bale. Joe (03:34):So, six generation farmer in Arizona. Talk to us about like the beginning of your family's history, I guess, as a farming family in Arizona. Trevor (03:45):My family that homesteads in Arizona, their last name was actually Beloat, B-E-L-O-A-T, the Beloat family. And they came out here as cattle ranchers. And the cattle ranching turned into farming and cattle, and then it turned into a feed lot in farming. The farm supplied the feed lot and then it transitioned into only farming. Now that's over a span of 120 plus years. But that's in a nutshell. So, they came over here, man, my great great great great grandpa. I think he had 14 kids or something. So, we currently farm a thousand acres, which if you think about it, we're very lucky to have that many acres when it's been split so many different times within, between children and family. Right. We're lucky to have that. But they, they came in 1820s, but they homesteaded in 1891. So, before Arizona was even a state, my great great great grandpa was integral in building the canal district that we currently use for irrigating our crops. So, we have an extremely long history. One of our cattle brands is actually in the top, one of the first, I think it's like a 450th or 440 something cattle brand. So, we've been here a very long time, have a deep history Wow. In the state. And then along the way my great grandpa Wallace Bales married Alberta Beloat, him and his son, my grandpa Steve, purchased the farm from the in-laws and became the Bales farm. Tracy (05:13):Let me ask a super basic question, which is, you know, a lot of people, I think they hear alfalfa and if they're not out in the country, they're thinking about those little alfalfa sprouts that you might get on your salads or is it garnish or something like that. But talk to us about what alfalfa actually is and the role that it plays in agriculture. Trevor (05:34):So, alfalfa is a very, very unique plant. It's a forage. It has great relative feed value properties or protein properties. It's very good for making high quality milk. It's very good for making high quality beef. What makes it so unique is its hardiness, especially for what we do now. This changes across the country because Arizona is much like a greenhouse effect. I kind of compare it to, because of our temperature. We are in the field eight to 12 times a year, we're in there cutting that alfalfa. Now there is no other crop other than grass. And even grass does not have the feed qualities that alfalfa has, that you can go in there and cut multiple times in a year. And then for several years after that, we can keep an alfalfa stand in for four to five years. Where other states where they're only in there cutting their crop two or three times, they can leave it in 6, 7, 8 years. But because of that...because that alfalfa stays in for so long, it gets a bad reputation. As to what you were talking about earlier is water. People call it a very high intensive water use crop. Well, a lot is being left out that crop stays in. It's a very efficient crop. When you look at all the work that goes into it. We plant it and we leave it in for four to five years. So, it is producing great feed quality for cattle, horses, milk cows, beef cows for five years, no other crop can do that. Corn, you plant it once, it takes a massive amount of water and then you harvest it at once. That's it. Tracy (07:08):So, it's basically a perennial, right? Like it keeps coming back? Trevor (07:12):Yes, yes. You're absolutely correct, yes. But it does go down in value where we do take it out, the yields aren't as good. So after about the fourth, fifth year, we'll see the yields will go down and we will take the field out. We'll apply manure to it for the fertilizer and go through the whole process. But usually we'll try to have a rotation crop in between it as well. Joe (07:33):But just this gets to the key question. I feel like we've sort of jumped right to it. So, people look at... Trevor (07:39):I'm sorry, I knew I did jump to it quickly. Joe (07:40):No, no, no. But this is really, I think, sort of the key of the argument, which is that you can grow alfalfa elsewhere outside of Arizona. But the point that you're trying to make is that there's something about the uniqueness of the Arizona climate. So, setting aside the water issues, yes. There's something about the Arizona climate specifically that gets you several terms in a year.  Trevor (08:03):Do you know the five Cs of Arizona? Joe (08:04):No, but I can't wait to learn them. Trevor (08:06):So. Right. So, and that back to like the history of why they farming in Arizona? Water and agriculture was, were never a hot topic in Arizona until Phoenix got to be fourth, fifth, sixth largest city in the country. Right. We've been farming here for like I just said, my family was here in the 1820s doing it. So, the water was never a problem until humans came in, cities came in, manufacturing, came in, farming actually paid for a lot of the water that is here in Phoenix salt River Project (SRP). The city couldn't afford it. So, the farmers came in and they paid for the water system and now the city is using it. But anyways, back to the five seeds. Yeah. What are the five Cs? Climate. Because our climate, copper, cattle, citrus and cotton. Arizona makes some of the best cotton in the world. We make the best alfalfa in the world. We make some of the best wheat and barley, and we make some of the best corn in the world. It's because of our climate. Like you said, alfalfa can be grown other places, but the quality is nowhere near the same. And it can't be grown everywhere that not all the climates can grow alfalfa. Tracy (09:28):So, one thing I read, and again, I'm not a farmer, so I'm just reading, trying to read various things on this topic. But one thing I read was that farmers in Arizona, like alfalfa, because it's reliable and because it grows well in that environment provided there's enough water around. Is that the right way of thinking about it? Trevor (09:50):Yeah, but that's, I mean, that's any crop, right? We're just like, in the industry, a farm farming is industry and what is supply and what is demand, right? Well, cotton used to be the demand. Citrus used to be the demand. And unfortunately, the demand with the mills in China and China's rules about importing cotton, cotton's no longer the demand. So, they go to what is the big demand, which right now there are a lot of dairies around. And dairies need a lot of protein to make high quality milk, which we actually ship all over the world from this area. And alfalfa is the most efficient way to make high quality milk. And if they think water's a problem. Now, if every farmer grew corn for the dairies, holy smokes, there wouldn't cotton not corn. Corn, man corn uses a lot of water. So yes, yes and no, what you said, yes and no. Yes, we like it, but for those same reasons yeah...any other crop is the same thing. Joe (10:42):Right. So, in the end whether we're growing alfalfa, whether we're growing corn, I guess whether they're growing soy, other things there's like a certain math, right? There's a certain amount of water, there's a certain amount of human labor.  You get a certain amount of feed at the end, those go to feed cows, and then the cows either become beef or they become for milk. Can you talk a little bit further about like, okay, you say like corn, that would be much worse if we switched to replacing alfalfa with corn. Like how does the math work out? What are we talking about? A loss with that replacement? Trevor (11:12):I've never grown corn myself. But my dad used to grow quite a bit. My grandfather would, for our own feedlot, by the time I came along, we don't grow as much. But the corn crop in a short like 120-day corn uses approximately the same amount of water as my whole year of the crop of alfalfa. Which is around seven-acre foot as we like to measure it with by acre feet, six-to-seven-acre feet. But now, where, I don't know because it, you would've to get a nutritionist is in that same acre of ground of soil, that one harvest of corn. What, what energy does it produce versus alfalfa? And that, I don't know that part. I'm just not in the dairy market at all.It gets a little out of my realm. Joe (12:01):Let me ask you another question then that's sort of related. So, you say like, Arizona alfalfa is better than alfalfa elsewhere. How much, talk us through that a little bit more. What is better about growing it in Arizona versus other parts of this country? Because it has grown elsewhere in this country. So is it the quality of the product or is it the yields that, or the amount of turns that you can get in a year from the same amount of land and then like, just talk us through the differences. Trevor (12:31):It's most of the quality. So a lot of other states. So we average about nine tons per acre for the year. Depending on the soil type, we can get nine to 10 tons per year now. But with, that's with 10 to 12 cuttings. A lot of other states, they can get seven to eight tons per year. But that's on half the cuttings. And so, each cutting is making a massive amount of hay each time. Well, the bigger the stand gets, the lower the quality gets. It gets really big; it gets real kind of tough. The stems get real big. And with that size, what's extremely important about alfalfa for a few reasons. One if you bale it with too much moisture, the bale will start to mold. It'll go bad. It can also, I don't know if you've ever heard of a hay fire, but if it has too much moisture and all the pressure in that baler, when they're packing the bale and you store, it creates heat from the moisture inside and the whatever's inside the bale and it'll catch on fire. So, the dry-down process, the curing process is extremely important. In a lot of the country, they don't have the climate we have, so they're fighting a lot more weather, than we fight. And so, the fact that we're able to get it dried down into cure and then also not have these massive two- or three-ton cuttings, like when you cut alfalfa, that's two tons or more. It's so big and thick and it's hard to get it to cure out. Well, we go in there every 30 days or less, 25 to 30 days, we cut it. It's nice, it's small and it's thinned out and it dries and it cures very pretty and it keeps a lot of color. And it keeps the leaf. The leaf is the important part of that plant. That's where all the nutrition is. And a lot of these other places have to flip it two or three times. Oh, it's not dried enough. Let's flip it over. You've got to get the bottom to dry out because when you cut it it's laying there on the ground. Well, the part that's up against the ground of the alfalfa stand, it's not seeing the sun ever. It's down there underneath this super thick alfalfa. So, then they flip it over, all right, now you dried out that side. Well darn it. And then a rainstorm came, we got to flip it back over again. Because now that side's wet. And so, they just don't produce the quality that we produce or the tonnage too. And with the rest of the country, a lot of the country does rely on, we call it dryland farming, where they do rely on rain when there's a drought across the country, Arizona fills that gap. And when there's too much rain, like there's been years where Idaho or Texas—and Texas is a huge hay market—they have so much rain, they cannot get in their fields and they cannot harvest it. So, guess what, it's almost the same problem as having the drought. Right? You don't get anything out of your fields. And so, Arizona fills in that gap. Tracy (15:18):So, I take the point about you know, it's easier to cure given the dryer weather and you know, maybe it's producing more higher quality alfalfa, but how much does the quality actually matter? Because doesn't most of this go to cows for feed? Like do the cows care about the color of the alfalfa hay that they're eating? Trevor (15:40):My specific market is the horse market. So, people with horses that have anywhere from, I mean, we've fed horses that are been in the Kentucky Derby. We sent hay to Florida where there's soup, where there's horses that fly on private jets back and forth from other countries for breeding purposes and racing. I don't know what they do. I'm not much of a horse person. But yes, to them it is extremely important. And even back to the cattle side, yes, it's important because that feed value changes and that feed value is extremely important. The older the hay gets, the lower the feed value goes down. That feed value is in direct connection to the quality of milk that, that the cow produces. So visual quality for horse people is extremely important. Trevor (16:27):Then test quality for cattle, for milk cows is extremely important. And beef, not so much for beef. I mean, the lower quality hay is fine, but once it's laying in the field and it gets rained on, that does take the quality away for both milk cows and or horses. Even that feed quality for specifically horses that are race horses, ropers, barrel racing horses, they need that high protein to be able to compete with whatever they're doing. So quality is very important. And there's a lot of people that have horses just as pets and they never ride them. They just like having a horse, in that situation it's not important. Tracy (17:09):Let me ask another basic how it works question, which is how do you actually water the alfalfa? So, we talked about harvesting and curing, but what does the watering process actually look like? And you mentioned that I think one of your grandparents had built canals on your farm that you presumably use for irrigation. Is that what you're doing? Trevor (17:29):So, it's crazy. With all this water stuff, Arizona has less acres than it's ever had, and we're more efficient than we've ever been. But, so the Heeler River...we farmed right off the Heeler River. Now the Heeler River, they used to call it the grand or the might, I forget what they called it, something Heeler River. And there was always water. So, they started this canal that was upriver and then the water would come in on this canal and it would, and they kind of followed the man. It's amazing the way they did it back then and how they were able to find without GPS, the high points of this little valley we're in. And they kind of followed this spine of this little valley. So, there's that main canal that feeds water to all the farmers that are within the district. So, we're very closely measured on how much water we use. People like to imagine we’re; we're just using it as much water as we can. We are not at all. We get cut off if we use too much. Like you can't just do whatever you want. So the district manages that water, that water goes along. Farmers like myself, I will order water a specific amount for a time and then it'll go down a lateral ditch that feeds off the canal. And that lateral ditch will then either will then carry water to the ditch that connects to my fields. Now all of our fields are laser leveled, so they're flat side to side with an end fall. So, there's a little bit of geometry involved with the farming. So, when you open the water in that designated area of the field, which might be 120 foot wide, quarter mile long, it flows very evenly from side to side. So, you're covering the whole thing. And that makes it very efficient work. Versus if you didn't have it flat, the water would just go all different areas. Like I said, it's section, you know, a hundred-acre field is sectioned off in 120-foot section. So, we're using a gradual decline in the land or fall to measure that specific area efficiently. And that's specifically how I irrigate. But what has become a very efficient way of irrigation is subsurface drip, which is becoming pretty popular in Arizona. I'd like to do it's just expensive. Joe (19:35):What is that? Trevor (19:35):That's where everything is underground. Joe (19:41):Ahh... Trevor (19:41):You're saving on evaporation, but you are getting that water directly to the root. I mean, you were just hitting that root with water. So, there's no evaporation. Which evaporation is not as much as people like to argue. 'Oh, Evaporation.' We've done studies. It's like 2% or less. It's, it's very, very low. Tracy (19:59):This is my dream for my garden. A system of underwater irrigation instead... Trevor (20:06):Sub-surface strip. Joe (20:07):Do amateur gardeners do that? Tracy (20:08):Yeah. Joe (20:09):Oh, I didn't know. Tracy (20:10):I mean, like, it would take a lot. But for instance, we, at the moment we have a bunch of underground like hoses and pipelines going through two and a half acres and they're all leaking. So that's fun. So maybe I actually already have subterranean irrigation in a way. Trevor (20:24):You kind of do.  Joe (20:25):You anticipated Trevor a question I was going to ask, which is about advances in water use technology over time. And I have to imagine maybe there are some similarities, but as you mentioned, it's gotten more efficient probably relative to when, you know, your ancestors were on the same land. How does it look differently? What are some of the advances that have been made since some of your ancestors were farming on the same land to get better output with less water? Trevor (20:51):That laser system has been huge. What they, what they used to do is everything was in furrows. Which a furrow is like a washboard, like an old washboard. You know what a washboard is? Joe (21:02):Yeah. Trevor (21:02):But then it runs, the water would run down there by having all those furrows. I mean, if you can imagine if you've got like a relatively flat area and you just open the water up, the water's going to follow the way of least resistance. So, you're just going to have this water go right down that one area, and then everything else is dry. So, what they did back then is they would do these furrows and then you'd have all these, these low like a washboard. The water would stay in the low spots and then, but then everything would get watered. But it was just not very efficient. It was rough. It was hard on equipment. And the planter or the furrow maker, man, they're heavy. They're before GPS, so you still weren't very straight man. And the fact that they thought of that was great. Right. Like man back then that they, that they saw that insight like, 'hey, let's make these washboards' if you will. And the water's hitting all areas, which is impressive. And then they came up with the laser system and now they use a GPS system.  But what we have, what is very foreign to pretty much every state except California and Arizona, there's a few other places, we call them borders. It's a dirt ridge that runs from the top of the field to the bottom of the field. And that's the earlier I was talking about sectioning off your field to irrigate you run a border from top to bottom and it's about two feet tall. And then you go over, and it depends, every field does have natural side fall, but the goal is to, between those two borders, get rid of that because you want that water to float evenly, you know, two inches deep across that hole hundred or however many feet, you know, a 100 and or 90, 60 feet. If it's a steep field, then you have a bunch of 60 feet borders. If it's a steep field, you have a fewer 120 plus borders. But that laser leveling has been an amazing tool for running irrigation. Extremely efficient. Like I said, we open up the area on that little section, 120 foot by quarter mile. And that water runs, like I said, two inches deep or less. Just the length of that. And I mean, you imagine it looks like a, it's like 120 foot, that water just going, just even with itself all the way and gets down to the bottom of the field, you shut it off and it just kind of drains itself right there. It just kind of stops right there. I mean, if you have irrigators that aren't paying attention and they'll fall asleep and they'll mess up. But when everything's going correctly, it manages so, so efficient and so smooth. So that, that laser system has been probably the best, most efficient way. Okay. I should say the best. It's probably the most efficient way just because what it costs to do versus the subsurface drip is definitely the most efficient way.  But oh, it costs, depending on like with oil prices, where they are and, and yeah. And like PVC, everything is, everything is petroleum based. So right now, it's probably 3,000 or more dollars per acre to put all that in. When petroleum-based things are cheaper, you can, $2,000 an acre used to be the kind of, the number. When you're looking at bigger farms, 4,000-acre farm, oh my gosh, that adds up really quick. Tracy (24:03):Let me ask a question that kind of like cuts to the heart of a lot of this discussion, but how real or salient are concerns over water for you right now? Like, have you witnessed water shortages during your time as a farmer? Has it affected your business? Are you getting perhaps more pressures from external sources to reduce your water use? How is it actually playing out for you? Trevor (24:33):So, for us, it's kind of unique, right? Where we farm, we're the area they call up, we waterlogged area with extremely, extremely salty water. And a lot of the water that we specifically use for the past 100 years has come from Phoenix water treatment plant. Where I farm, we're not allowed to grow produce because it comes from water treatment. We don't get water from the Colorado River. I don't get water from the Salt River project. Our water comes from Eastern Arizona as the rains come down and it trickles down the Salt River and it comes into the Heeler River and it keeps our aquifer very full of water rather. But our water is so salty. And then, then taking the water from the, paying the city for their water back before Phoenix was, was a big city. They loved that we took their water. And so we've never really had a right where I farm specifically anyways. We've never had a fear of losing our water until with technology. The water treatment plants have gotten really good at cleaning water and desalinization plants. They look out, no one ever wanted our water. They're like, 'no, no, no, we don't want your water. It's disgusting. It's super salty. We can't use it for anything.' Like, we're glad you guys are actually using it because if you weren't, this place would be almost like a swamp down here. Like there are areas if you, you if you can drive with a ground is always slightly muddy. That's because that water's like three or four feet underground. It's just right down there. And so, they love that we're farming it, pumping it out of the ground and using it because they don't want to deal with, with the swamp, I guess. I mean not a literal swamp, but what's also changed a lot years ago they brought in a tree called a salt cedar tree. And it's from, I think it's from Africa or the Middle East. I don't remember where it's from, but it's not native to Arizona. And this tree uses a lot of water and it has overgrown the Heeler River or my, the river I just told you I farmed on. And it uses a lot of water. And since that tree has been brought in and it's infested the river and even the desert, the water doesn't flow down the Gila River very much anymore. Rarely does it. Senators Senna Kerr, she's been pushing and other people then pushing, let's clean out this non-native invasive tree that uses a lot of water. Animal rights are like, oh, there's owls and stuff living in there and the butterflies or something. Joe (26:58):Big picture. Okay, maybe your farm specifically is in a position where it's not a, for historically a lot of the water that used, no one else wanted it. Do you feel like at some point, like for your industry, and I'm sure you talked to other farmers, like this is coming to a head like, okay, there is this much water that can be used for agriculture. There's household demand, there's industrial demand. Like is someone going to have to give here? Trevor (27:24):Yes. Somewhere it is going to have to give, I guess I didn't finish my other thought, your question. With desalinization plants, people are now looking at our water thinking, oh huh. 'There's A bunch of water right there that these farmers have that we can have.' And now that the city is good at cleaning the water, they're looking at it thinking, oh, maybe we'll just go buy this water from the farmers. Once there a 100-year deal pop ends with the, with the city. So that is a fear of ours. Yes. And so then yes, to your point, we do realize that there's, something's going to have to give and there used to be good laws in place about where you could build because it is a desert. The idea back, and you'd have to go back and look at the history and judgements and stuff, but they said you, you had to bill where you could have water. Well then it got really fishy that, because the thought was as home builders and manufacturing bought property from farmers, that water would then go from a farmer to a house. So, you're, you just traded from one industry to another. Well then, the water laws up in, you know, over my pay grade in the city started. Oh, well technically we could send water up to this real pretty area over here where in the mountains where they want to build some houses. Then all of a sudden water gets sent another way. Oh, there's a freeway up here. It sure would be nice to have buildings and stuff next to the freeway. Well, so then they started buying, buying property in the desert and building in the desert. And it kind of skipped around the farm ground. And then now everyone's wondering like, oh, now we're low on water. Well, 80 years ago when they kind of looked ahead to the future, they said, well if we trade farm ground for housing and development, the water just changes traded hands. Well then, I said, I don't know what happened before my time, but some water rules were changed and that's where it gets pretty fishy. And that to me, that's the real story. Who changed these water rules? I mean, like I said, the farmers didn't change a rule. We've been here farming for over a hundred, we're farming less acres than ever. But so, there were some things that kind of changed. And that'd be interesting to get the full story on that because like, yeah, there's big housing developments up in these areas that are very arid. There's no water, there's no farming that ever happened there. They just boom, let's throw in these several thousand homes and neighborhoods and use a whole bunch of water Tracy (30:06):So, let me ask you a, maybe a tough question, but is there anything that would make you reconsider or maybe rethink growing alfalfa? Like what would be the conditions under which that is no longer either desirable or profitable for you? Trevor (30:26):Oh, it's just like any other industry, right? I mean a car manufacturer, what would make them want to stop manufacturing cars? It's all market based. As long as we have water and soil, you know, I can grow whatever the market is asking. We, we don't, I don't grow alfalfa because that's what I want to grow. It's, that's what the market asks for. Tracy (30:44):Yeah, it makes sense. Trevor (30:46):I mean it's all based on, you know, paying my bills. What pays my bills? And right now, it's alfalfa. If cotton came back and cotton was the, was back to being king, they, you say cotton is king all of a sudden cotton was what, what the mills wanted. What, what the markets were calling for man would grow cotton. Joe (31:04):I just realized your road is on Beloat Road. So that's the family, that's the family name. Have any home builders, because when we talked about Arizona land, they're talking about, well a lot of the what is, you know, where home builders build was formerly agricultural land. Is your area an area in which at some point are home builders potentially trying to bid on your land? Or is there ever a point where the economics in your area could be such that a home builder would find more value from it in writing you a big check than growing an alfalfa? Trevor (31:37):Yeah. Right now, we're about 10 miles from the freeway. And so that's what kind of keeps that from happening. But there's a bunch of plans of like a reliever freeway coming through our area. And I mean it's all about transportation, right? Any, anywhere it's generally relates directly to transportation. And when you're far away from a freeway or whatever, something that's around you, it's all related to that. That's why all of the growth has happened around the freeway. Right. I interstate 10, I-17, orr I say at 202 over here, it's all based around the 101, the freeways and we're about eight to 10 miles off the freeway. So, if we were right on the freeway, yeah, they'd be knocking on the door. But it's all based on transportation. So Joe (32:25):I just have one last question, and I guess it's sort of open-ended, but we started this talking about all these debates that happened about water use in Arizona. What's sort of like the one thing that you think people are missing big picture when they discuss this and like, what's sort of like the one thing you would like more people to understand about the distribution of water in Arizona? Trevor (32:46):I guess I said it earlier, water was never an issue until the city got as big as it was. We're farming in the state, less acres than we've ever farmed, Andre using less water than we've ever used, and we're more efficient than we've ever been. And so, as the city gets bigger now water's an issue as you, you guys talked about earlier, why they're building these chip manufacturing plants in Arizona. Why don't they build them somewhere? They don't have to build them here. You know, we farm here because this is the only place in the United States you can farm like this, this in parts of central California. That's it. You can't farm like this. Joe (33:19):And when you say like this anywhere else. When you say like this? Yeah, what do you mean. Trevor (33:23):Year-round and produce the quality of crops that we produce right there. I mean there's things we can't grow here, but that they grow all over the Midwest, which is why they grow them there. I could go farm somewhere else, but I'd be farming a different crop, I guess. Right. Without Arizona. And, and really the scary one is California, if you ever look up how much milk or produce the Central Valley California produces.  Oh my gosh. If they lose their water, everything we eat vegetable or produce related is going to come from another country and it's going to be sprayed with every nasty chemical to kill every single bug that ever lived so they can sell it to the United States because we got rid of all the water in, or the farming in California. That's what scares me. Yeah. I love Arizona and it's where I farm, but for the sake of our country, California scares me the most holy if you if we lose Central Valley farming. But anyways, we've been doing this for over a hundred years here and, it's never been an issue until the city got really big Joe (34:23):Trevor Bales of Bales Hay farm. Really appreciate you coming on a really good perspective. Trevor (34:28):I thought we were going to talk about alfalfa markets. That's what's interesting to me. What, Joe (34:32):What did we miss on alfalfa markets? Trevor (34:34):So most other markets are trackable and the cotton market, the wheat market, the barley market. There's the corn market. Alfalfa is like you talk about, want to talk about like the wild west of markets. I mean, it's so similar to the stock market on, Tracy (34:48):There's no like alfalfa futures or anything, Trevor (34:51):Huh? No, there, there aren't. And so, like every other, like, like beef bar, like everything but like alfalfa. So like right now actually we are in a crazy, I mean, it's just falling like a rock. Tracy (35:02):It got, there is and alfalfa producer price index. Joe (35:05):Yeah. And it is falling. Huh? So, what's going on there? Trevor (35:09):The United States has exported its agriculture things for us, as long as once boats were, once we started shipping stuff out of the country, we've been exporting so forever. Yeah. We export a lot of hay out of the country, those exporters last year and the year before that for some reason came in swinging real hard, wanting to buy a lot of alfalfa. And this is all over the country too. They buy like all over the west coast, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona. They, they buy a lot. Yeah. So, they came in swinging and it, they, they raised the price up. I remember 300 used to be the high number. And this is per ton. We all, I always think of things per ton. Yeah. I think Wow. Wow. That hay was sold for $285 a ton. Wow. Maybe one day we'll hit 300. Well in less than a year, it went from $300 to $400 a ton. And then it went upwards of like $360 a ton or $460 a ton. It went. So, it went way up there, which is very high. But then this year they came back in and they're not buying. Well, everyone got this start off the year again with this false thinking, thinking it was going to be high again. And so, I have to buy a lot of hay because of the, luckily, we've run a successful business and we sell a lot of hay to all over the country. All of my hay stays local. It doesn't get exported, but it stays here in the in the US. And so, we harvest all our stuff, then I harvest other people's hay and I buy it from them. Well, they are looking at what they think the market is the beginning of the year, and there, well, we think that, you know, it's still $330, $340. Okay. So here we are in March and April harvesting hay and paying $340 for it. 330, 340. And then as it's been going, it's just this crazy uneasy nobody knows. And you're all these weird numbers and the exporters aren't buying. And all of a sudden now, so I purchased hay two months ago for $340 a ton. I think I'm going to purchase hay this month for $195 a ton. Which I guess if you don't understand, that's a huge swing Yeah. In, in our industry from one to the other. And it's just such an interesting market. I mean it, especially in the stock market and all the movies you watch, like, it's, it's all about what, how, what do you, what do you think? What does this guy think? You know? Or it doesn't necessarily matter what's really happening. It's what is your perception and what does, what do people think is going to happen? And so, everyone starts making decisions on what they think is going to happen. And everyone thought the market was going to stay high. And I mean, to see it fall over a hundred dollars a ton in a couple months. I mean that's crazy. Joe (37:46):We needed an alfalfa futures market. Trevor, thank you so much. I'm glad we got that context in the sort of the current day market swing. Yeah. But really appreciate you coming on Odd Lots. Trevor (37:57):Yeah. Thanks guys. Joe (37:58):Yeah, that was great. Thank you so much, Tracy. I really liked that conversation. I mean, there was a lot in there, but just to start, you know, I liked hearing about like the technological advantages and irrigation and farming and like now how they use lasers to make sure it's perfectly flat and stuff like that. Tracy (38:26):Oh God. My husband got one of those to like measure hanging pictures on the walls and like terrace slopes and things like that. Oh yeah. And he will not stop using it to measure. So, it looks very cool Joe (38:35):Measuring the flatness of things. Tracy (38:37):A couple things stood out for me. So, number one, I think people hear, oh, why are we farming alfalfa in the desert? It makes no sense. But Trevor's point about how it's actually easier Yes. To cure the alfalfa hay. That makes a lot of sense to me. It doesn't necessarily mean it's efficient from a water perspective, but you could see why that would be beneficial if you're making these giant rolls of dried grass essentially. And then the other thing that struck me was, you know, this idea that a lot of the alfalfa is going to fancy horses. Yeah, it does seem like horses’ kind of escape a lot of climate change contribution scrutiny, right? Everyone always talks about cows, not the Joe (39:15):Horses. Someone is going to some horse person out there is going to get really angry. We're Tracy (39:19):Going to have to do a follow-up. That's fine. I think horses are an easier target. Be honest. I don't think, to be honest, there's Joe (39:24):Many of them. I don't think there is many of them. I don't think there, I mean, no offense to Trevor, I don't think that and market is as crucial, but you know, what I think was interesting in a point that he made that sort of like helped things click. Whereas he points out, you know, like in some places you'll get drought and some places you'll get, sometimes you'll get flooding. Right. And so, what really, one thing about Arizona, one thing that's nice about the desert, it's consistent. Tracy (39:44):Consistent... Joe (39:45):It's consistent, it's predictable, right? And so, it's like, okay, there are obviously drawbacks in such as the fact that there is like, you know, the water is ambiguous, but you know what you're going to get. And so, once you start from that standpoint, like you can like get a, it's every on every other metric, Arizona is very efficient for these crops. Tracy (40:02):Totally. And that was a perspective that we hadn't really heard before. But, but again, it's one of those things like, okay, it made sense for a long time, but as the city's developed to Trevor's point, yeah. As we build these semiconductor factories, it does feel like decisions, tough decisions might need to be made.  Joe (40:22):But on the other hand, like maybe the answer is to keep Arizona an agricultural powerhouse and not continue to spread Phoenix as far as the eye could see. Like we sort of like, oh, everyone's moving to Phoenix, therefore we need less agriculture. But it is good to get the perspective of the people in the agriculture and say, yeah, but why does Phoenix need to just keep growing in all directions Tracy (40:41):Or move the fabs elsewhere? Joe (40:42):Or move the fabs elsewhere. Yeah. Tracy (40:44):Yeah. All right. Shall we leave it there? Joe (40:45):Let's leave it there.  Follow Trevor Bales on Instagram  @baleshay\"]\n",

      "['The Screen Actors Guild, which represents some 160,000 performers, announced a walkout Thursday after failing to reach a new labor agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers, which represents studios including Walt Disney Co. and Netflix. The Writers Guild of America, meanwhile has been on strike since May 2. SAG-AFTRA Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland speaks at a press conference in Los Angeles. Russia is finally cutting crude exports, at the most advantageous moment possible.   Moscow has pledged to curb shipments to global markets by 500,000 barrels a day next month. It’s a show of unity with fellow OPEC+ leader Saudi Arabia, but also an attempt to answer months of questions about whether Russia could really have been cutting oil production — as announced in February — while simultaneously raising crude exports.  August gives Moscow the perfect opportunity to make these important gestures at minimal cost. Companies can redirect crude away from export terminals to domestic refiners, which will be running at a higher rate thanks to the end of spring maintenance and a period of generous state subsidies.  In fact, Russia should be able to achieve its export target without needing additional production cuts. Bloomberg Terminal  “Seeking to strengthen its ties with Saudi Arabia, Russia is set to fulfill its export cut pledge,” said Viktor Katona, head crude analyst at market intelligence firm Kpler Ltd. “The 500,000-barrel-a-day export cut will be fully absorbed by the domestic refining segment.”    Russian officials have given repeated assurances that the country’s 500,000 barrel-a-day production cut was implemented in March. But there’s no official data to back this up — the figures were classified in April — and tanker-tracking data show exports rising steadily from that month until mid-May.  This was happening just as Saudi Arabia was making additional voluntary production cuts, prompting some markets watchers to conclude that the kingdom was shouldering most of the burden of balancing the global crude market. While Riyadh has never publicly questioned the veracity of Moscow’s output claims, it has urged more transparency.  Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said last week in Vienna that Russia’s announcement on August oil flows was “more meaningful” because it applied to exports.  Russian oil producers will decide on their own whether they need to make extra output cuts in August, but the nation’s task is to reduce exports next month, Tass citedBloomberg Terminal Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak as saying in Krasnoyarsk. “We’ll load less, Russia will supply less to oil markets,” he said.    Seaborne shipments of Russian crude are starting to show signs of falling. Exports from the country’s western ports in the four weeks to July 9 dropped substantially below their average February level for the first time, after volumes surged during the intervening months, according to vessel tracking data monitored by Bloomberg and corroborated by other data sources. Rystad Energy A/S expects Russia’s daily seaborne oil shipments next month to drop to 3.1 million to 3.2 million barrels, compared with about 3.7 million barrels in April and May. Less crude will be loaded onto tankers for export because of a “seasonal increase in refinery utilization” within the country, according to the consultant’s senior oil markets analyst Viktor Kurilov. Setting the pattern for August, Russia’s downstream facilities are already churning through crudeBloomberg Terminal. As of early July, the domestic oil-processing rates reached a 12-week high, according to Bloomberg calculations based on industry statistics.  Those refineries are receiving state subsidies for selling some of their gasoline and diesel at home that averaged $1 billionBloomberg Terminal a month in the first half of the year, according to Bloomberg calculations based on the ministry’s data.  When Russia’s Novak announced the 500,000 barrel-a-day export cut he didn’t give a baseline for the adjustment. That makes it difficult to assess how much crude the country will actually ship overseas in August, and the resulting impact on prices.  “It comes down to how many Russian barrels get removed,” said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst at UBS Group AG. “If the baseline is the May exports, the impact will likely be modest” because shipments in that month were so high, he said.  If Russia offsets the reduction in crude exports with an increase in shipments of refined fuels from its domestic refineries, the effect could be even more modest, he said. Oil has risen since Moscow and Riyadh announced the August cuts. Russia’s flagship Urals crude topped $60 a barrel on Wednesday, breaching the price cap imposed by the G-7. Brent crude exceeded $80 a barrel for the first time since May, but the international benchmark is still down this year.      The window of opportunity for Russia to cut oil exports and yet keep output largely intact is short. The real test of Moscow’s willingness to sacrifice sales volumes will come in September. That’s when the nation’s Finance Ministry plans to cut by half the generous fuel subsidies and keep them curbed through 2026Bloomberg Terminal, according to Russian newspaper Kommersant.  This change will reduce the appetite for crude among domestic refiners, which will hardly be able to raise domestic prices of gasoline or diesel to compensate for the lost incentives, said Mikhail Turukalov, independent US-based oil-products analyst. As a result, Russian companies will be more interested in selling to international markets, provided the government doesn’t introduce export quotas, he said.  Russia’s refineries will also be at the peak of their fall maintenance season in mid-September, Turukalov said. At that point, the country’s daily crude-processing may drop to 4.76 million to 5.1 million barrels, compared to 5.35 million to 5.57 million in August, he estimated, based on preliminary maintenance plans of the facilities. These factors would make it more painful for Russia to extending its export cuts beyond August, according to Kpler and Rystad Energy. Curbing overseas shipments in September “would require further production cuts,” Rystad’s Kurilov said. “As we have seen, Russia cannot do that quickly.” ']\n",

      "['Shares of Progressive Corp. fell the most since 2000 after the insurance company released second quarter results that missed analysts’ estimates.  The stock tumbled by about 13% on Thursday, following the report that its combined ratio — a measure of underwriting profitability — came in worse than expected. Mayfield Village, Ohio-based Progressive was the worst performer among S&P 500 stocks on the day. Shares of the company closed at around $115 Thursday, after ending Wednesday at about $132. For an insurer, a combined ratio of less than 100% would signal that it’s bringing in an underwriting profit, or in other words, taking in more from premiums than it is spending on claims. For the second quarter, Progressive’s combined ratio came in at 100.4%Bloomberg Terminal, meaning the company spent one dollar and four cents on claims and expenses for every premium dollar received. The figure is also higher than analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg of 97.1%. “Progressive’s June month was one of the toughest it has suffered in recent years,” Piper Sandler & Co. analyst Paul Newsome wrote in a note to clients. “The bottom line is that the profitability and reserving problems at Progressive are bigger than we expected.” Piper Sandler’s Newsome, who holds a neutral rating on the stock, lowered his price target to $126 from $136.  “Some of the June result is just bad luck from catastrophe losses, but the underlying combined ratio is not snapping back as fast as many would have expected even with Progressive’s exceptional operating expense management,” he wrote. Other insurance stocks also underperformed on the day, including Allstate Corp. which dipped 2.6% and Travelers Companies Inc. which was down 1.7%. The results from Progressive show that auto insurers are “continuing to be impacted by elevated severity,” Wells Fargo & Co. analyst Elyse Greenspan wrote in a note to clients.  A greater frequency and severity of accidents, combined with higher costs to repair or replace damaged vehicles, have pummeled auto insurers this year. More broadly, property and casualty players have struggled to maintain profitability as they deal with those factors as well as heightened costs linked to extreme weather events. An S&P Global Market Intelligence report for 2023 sees the insurance industry closing out the year with a combined ratio of 100.8% — essentially meaning that, for every dollar of premium insurers take in, a dollar and eight cents will go toward claims. “While that marks an improvement from the calendar-year 2022 result of 102.6%, it remains above the 100.0% threshold that serves as the metaphorical break-even point for underwriting profitability,” reads the report. “We project a return to a sub-100% combined ratio in 2024.”']\n",

The Southeast Asian country intends to raise $1 billion in Islamic bonds, also known as sukuk bonds, Diokno said in an interview Thursday on the sidelines of an event in Toronto.  “We want to penetrate the Middle East market,” said Treasurer Rosalia de Leon, adding that banks don’t have a mandate for the transaction yet. “We’re working on the structure” of the notes, she said. The volume of outstanding sukuk bonds during the 12 months ended June 30 grew by 10% compared to the prior-year period and for the first time exceeded $800 billion, Fitch Ratings said in a reportBloomberg Terminal Thursday. While issuance may slow in the third quarter, it is expected to pick up in the final three months of the year, Fitch said.  The government seeks to ease its fiscal burden and bring the budget shortfall to 3% of economic output by the end of president Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s term in 2028, from around 7% last year. The planned borrowing — potentially consisting of a 5-year and a 10-year tranche — may take place later this year, subject to market conditions, de Leon said. “We are looking at 10 years, but we are also being advised that the sweet spot would be five years,” she said.  The Philippines is among Asia’s fastest-growing economies, beating growth expectations in the first quarter. Gross domestic product in the three months through March rose 6.4% from a year earlier, compared to a 6.2% median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The government is targeting gross domestic product growth of 6% to 7% this year.  On top of the sukuk transaction, the government plans to raise $2 billion by selling US dollar denominated bonds to retail investorsBloomberg Terminal, Diokno said.

The position is small, a person familiar with the situation said, asking not to be named discussing non-public information. It comes as the hedge fund said in an investor note this week that 2024 could bring in “positive shocks in politics and the economy.” “A more significant regime change, which would include a more front-loaded fiscal adjustment and a robust reform agenda, would allow for a relevant re-pricing of assets,” Vista wrote. “We see interesting asymmetries in some sectors of the stock market, especially in financials.”  Vista declined to comment beyond the letter.  In the investor note, the fund says current Economy Minister Sergio Massa has the incentives to reach a deal with the International Monetary Fund, while the El Nino event could favor a recovery in agriculture exports next year. It also touted the possibility of conservative Patricia Bullrich consolidating votes for the opposition.

The Sharara deposit in the southwest of the country will gradually halt production, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. The shutdown follows a stoppage at Libya’s El Feel fieldBloomberg Terminal, which was also targeted by protesters.  There was also disruption in Nigeria, the largest oil producer in Africa. That country’s Forcados oil terminal was stopped so that divers could inspect a possible leak, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Brent crude settled above $81 a barrel Thursday to reach an 11-week high. Libyan oil exports generally go to Spain, Italy and France, so a prolonged disruption could mean more West African crude moving into Northwest Europe, said Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth. The outage comes as signs emerge that supply curbs from Saudi Arabia and Russia are starting to tighten the market, jolting oil futures for their recent torpor. Sharara and the Waha field, which is further east, pump similar amounts of oil. Before the disruption, Sharara was at about 250,000 to 260,000 barrels a day, and Waha was at about 290,000 barrels a day.  A Russian general who accused army chiefs of “treacherously” ousting him for criticizing troop losses in the war in Ukraine has sparked a political feud within President Vladimir Putin’s ruling party, the latest sign of tensions over the military following the mutiny by Wagner mercenaries. Major General Ivan Popov, whose call sign is “Spartacus,” said in an audio message that he’d been removed as commander of Russia’s 58th army in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region after he spoke to Defense Ministry chiefs “at the highest level, extremely harshly” about shortcomings in combat operations.  Popov told his “gladiators” in the message that he’d emphasized “the large-scale death and injury of our brothers from enemy artillery” because of an absence of countermeasures. “Apparently, the senior bosses sensed some kind of danger” from the criticisms and quickly arranged an order from Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to remove him, Popov said. While Ukrainian forces couldn’t penetrate Russian defenses, he said, the army’s top leadership “hit us from the rear, treacherously and viciously decapitating the army at the most difficult and tense moment.” Popov’s accusations and the political dispute over his removal underline continued tensions among officials after the June 24 mutiny by Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin that aimed to remove Shoigu and army Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov for failures in Russia’s disastrous invasion of Ukraine.  Andrey Gurulev, a lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party who’s on the State Duma’s defense committee, made the general’s complaints public by posting the audio recording on his Telegram channel late Wednesday.  That prompted Andrey Turchak, a top party official and a senator in the upper house of parliament, to accuse Gurulev of making a “political show” of the general’s departure. “The army was and remains out of politics,” Turchak said Thursday on Telegram. Popov and Prigozhin exposed “big, systemic” problems in the army as well as the unpopularity of Russia’s military leadership, said Sergei Markov, a political consultant with close Kremlin ties. “And now a third problem has been added — the disintegration of military discipline, an open manifestation of disloyalty.” Putin Claims He’s Back in Control. Russia’s Elite Isn’t Sure Another top general, Sergei Surovikin, hasn’t been seen in public since the rebellion ended, as the security services seek to establish whether elements in the military knew about Prigozhin’s plans in advance. Surovikin, who was repeatedly praised by the Wagner founder, has been quizzed by investigators over his links to the mercenaries, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Putin appointed Gerasimov as overall head of Russia’s invasion force in January in place of Surovikin, a career military officer dubbed “General Armageddon” for his ruthless tactics during operations in Syria. He’s also stood by Shoigu, a long-standing ally who’s served alongside Putin for decades. Putin’s Hunting Pal Is at the Center of Kremlin Caterer’s Mutiny Putin said Russia had been on the brink of “civil war” after Prigozhin’s forces advanced to within 200 kilometers (124 miles) of Moscow, meeting little resistance from army units, before calling off the revolt under a deal brokered by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.  With the US, Europe and China puzzling over the political fallout from the rebellion that shattered Putin’s image as Russia’s invincible leader, the Kremlin disclosed on Monday that the president met Prigozhin and 35 Wagner commanders for nearly three hours of talks five days after the mutiny that he had denounced as treason.']\n",

      "['The cost of servicing US government debt jumped by 25% in the first nine months of the fiscal year, reaching $652 billion and contributing to a major widening in the budget deficit. For the nine months through June, the federal deficit hit $1.39 trillion, up some 170% from the same period the year before, according to Treasury Department data released on Thursday. The widening shortfall may play into Republican lawmakers’ pressure to curtail federal spending. While the GOP, which controls the House, did a deal with the Biden administration to suspend the debt limit earlier this summer, a fresh fight looms over appropriations for the 2024 fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. Higher interest rates have been a key driver of the deficit, with the Federal Reserve boosting its benchmark rate by 5 percentage points since it began hiking in March last year. Five-year Treasury yields are now about 3.96%, versus 1.35% at the start of last year. As lower-yielding securities mature, the Treasury faces steady increases in the rates it pays on outstanding debt. The weighted average interest for total outstanding debt by the end of June was 2.76%, the highest level since February 2012, according to the Treasury. That’s up from 1.80% a year before, the department’s data show. Still, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has played down concerns about higher rates. She has instead flagged that the ratio of interest payments to GDP, after adjustment for inflation, remains historically low. Read More: Yellen’s Debt Yardstick Belies American Angst Over US Borrowing Another key reason for the widening deficit this year has been a weakening in Treasury revenues, thanks especially to a reduced capital gains tax take. Last year’s slumps in stocks, bonds and other assets meant lower receipts for the government. Inflation has also boosted a number of government spending items.']\n",

The behavioral shift began shortly after the Easter holiday in early April, he said.  “Importantly, where we see it, it is usually not a trade down to lower-priced alternatives within the category; rather, it’s an overall category slowdown,” he said. Connolly added that he expects the behavior is short term and that “people aren’t eating less.” Read More: In Troubling Sign, Shoppers Skimp on Toothpaste Certain grocery categories are feeling the pullback more than others, according to data from researcher NIQ. In food, overall units sold are down 2% this year, with some of the biggest declines coming in frozen meals, fruit juice and soup. People are likely “burning through inventory in their homes,” said NIQ’s Carman Allison. “We’re spending more, but we’re buying less.”  Conagra’s resultsBloomberg Terminal point to the dilemma facing consumer-focused companies that have relied on price increases to make up for softness in the number of items they’ve been selling. In the quarter ended May 28, the owner of the Slim Jim brand reported a 7.7% drop in volume, but revenue rose 2.2% thanks largely to higher prices. In an interview, Connolly said that Americans are away from home more often and shifting spending to other categories. “The consumer is very creative and very crafty in terms of finding ways to stretch their budget,” he said. “One of the ways they make that happen is they just cut back temporarily on the stuff that they buy in order to be able to fund other expenses. That’s what we believe.”']\n",

      "['The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s biggest round of reforms in years for the $5.5 trillion money-fund industry fall short of fixing what ultimately caused markets to seize up in the pandemic turmoil, according to Bank of America Corp.  Final rules passed on Wednesday increased minimum daily and weekly liquidity, removed the threshold that imposes costs on withdrawals and instituted a fee for large redemptions for primary funds that invest in commercial paper. While these measures may discourage rapid outflows and prevent a dilution in remaining shareholders’ assets, markets still remain vulnerable to sudden freezes that forced the Federal Reserve to intervene in early 2020 for the second time in 12 years.  Read More: SEC Imposes Money-Market Fund Rules to Thwart Rapid Outflows The March 2020 “money market stress was driven by a ‘dash for cash’ and insufficiently liquid secondary market” for commercial paper, strategists Mark Cabana and Katie Craig wrote in a note to clients. “The only way to thaw the market would be through official sector intervention.”  In the wake of the early-pandemic market turmoil, reports from global regulators blamed money funds for freezing vital financial markets, resulting in calls for new rules aimed at penalizing investors trying to retrieve their money quickly during a crisis. While the industry and official sector was largely in agreement that the some of the changes instituted in 2016 didn’t prevent the kind of outflows that occurred in March 2020, officials pushed for new rules aimed at discouraging runs. SEC Chair Gary Gensler in comments Wednesday focused on investor redemptions and the need to shore up that part of the market. When markets enter times of stress, some investors — fearing dilution or illiquidity — may try to escape the bear,” he said. “We have observed this play out in times of stress, including during the 2008 financial crisis and the dash for cash in March 2020. Left unchecked, such stress can undermine these critical funds.”   The 2008 financial crisis exposed major issues with money funds, which are supposed to be ultra-safe havens for individuals and companies to park cash, and regulators spent years implementing measures intended to slow withdrawals during times of stress. But the round of changes instituted in 2016 didn’t prevent the kinds of outflows that occurred in March 2020. Instead, panicked investors yanked billions from prime money funds money funds in less than two months, helping upend the entire commercial-paper market that provides a life-line to companies seeking to raise short-term cash. Bank of America strategists suggested alternative solutions such as deepening liquidity in the commercial paper market, improving dealers ability to intermediate in markets and even creating conditions where official sector intervention would be more acceptable. Without these changes, they warn that money managers could still be inclined to sell CP and certificates of deposit in times of strife like they tried to do in 2020, even with higher liquidity thresholds.  “Future investor behavior in an acute flight to quality episode could see prime MMF or other short-duration asset managers rapidly sell CP & CD again, even with the higher liquidity thresholds,” they wrote. “Limited dealer balance sheet capacity could then see another market freeze.”']\n",

      "['The New York Stock Exchange plans to delist Azure Power Global Ltd., an Indian renewable-power firm controlled by Canadian pension funds that’s embroiled in a corruption investigation.  The exchange said Thursday it will start the delisting processBloomberg Terminal after Azure warned it still can’t meet a deadline for filing its overdue 2022 financial statements.  The Azure investment has been a governance nightmare for Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, Canada’s second-largest pension manager, which acquired 56% of the company at a cost of about $480 million, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the no. 2 holder with about 23%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   The New Delhi-based power producer is in the midst of an investigation into alleged “corrupt activities” in connection with one of its projects. The probe has been going on since last year, when it received a whistleblower complaint into misconduct by employees, and the new chief executive officer quit suddenly. The shares have lost more than 80% of their value since that disclosureBloomberg Terminal; trading is now suspended.  In the meantime, Azure has appointed a new accounting firm, ASA & Associates LLP, to help finish financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 2022, but it might take about three more monthsBloomberg Terminal. The company’s shares “are not suitable for listing, because the company is a late filer,” NYSE said in a statement. Azure had earlier said it may appeal any delisting decision.  Azure has given few specifics about its internal investigation, though it also encompasses “certain asset acquisition transactions.” In May, the company appointed a new CEO and chief financial officer.  “When there’s irregularities from a governance standpoint, the action plan is immediate and ruthless from the Caisse,” Charles Emond, the pension manager’s CEO, said in an interview in June.  Although CDPQ has a significant loss on paper from the investment, “the reality is that there is still very good assets underneath. There is a plant, a company that distributes electricity to millions of Indians,” Emond said. “Share price is one thing, value is another one.”  Spokespeople for CDPQ and Omers declined to comment. “Azure Power could face more risk of a technical default on its dollar bonds if it’s delisted from the NYSE. It’s nearing a July 15, 2023 deadline for filing audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 2022, and a maximum 12-month cure period ends on Aug. 16, 2023. The firm could look to obtain a waiver to avoid a default; that would require majority bondholder consent. This might not come easily, given the lack of clarity on its ability to resolve governance issues and the lack of audited financial information.” — Bloomberg Intelligence credit analyst Sharon Chen']\n",

      "['Electricite de France SA will curtail production at one nuclear reactor this weekend as a heat wave restricts the amount of water that can be discharged into the Rhone River. The utility had warned of possible curbs on output earlier this week as warm weather swept southern France, pushing up temperatures on the Rhone. EDF uses water to cool its reactors before releasing it into the river, and overheating the waterway can threaten fish and other wildlife. One of four 900-megawatt reactors at the Bugey power station will reduce generation to zero from Saturday morning to Sunday evening due to “environmental issues”, EDF saidBloomberg Terminal in a notice Thursday. It added that that the duration may change if the weather forecast changes.  The move isn’t a cause for concern in terms of near-term security of supply, especially as power demand will probably be lower this weekend as a result of the Bastille Day holiday. But it’s a reminder that EDF will have to keep adapting its atomic plants to warmer summers and potential natural disasters caused by climate change. The company and competitors such as Engie SA may use more natural gas to generate power in the coming days, potentially slowing the seasonal filling of gas storage. They may also tap hydro reservoirs, which are ample for the time of year, and France may export less electricity or turn to imports at times. Last year, when France also had a hot summer, EDF was able to secure several waivers from the grid operator. That meant the company could continue to release water into rivers when a string of reactor outages tightened supply. But river temperatures are strictly monitored and controlled. Rules on discharges have cut EDF’s annual nuclear output by an average of 0.3% since 2000. That could deepen to 1.5% in 2050, company projections show. As a result, the utility is seeking ways to curb water use as part of its plans to adapt to global warming.']\n",

Now, the Stifel strategist says this is as good as it gets. The S&P 500’s surge has taken many investors by surprise, exceeding even Bannister’s bullish forecast of 4,300 points by mid-year. While bets of an imminent end to interest-rate hikes have kept the gains going in July, Bannister predicts that inflation will be stickier than some are counting on. “I would say there’s a decent risk of a January 2024 recession,” he said during a call on Thursday, predicting the S&P 500 will “level out” around 4,400 this year. “I think inflation is stuck with us for a while at a higher level than it used to be.” Bannister’s call was contrarian Bloomberg Terminalat the start of 2023, when a majority of prognosticators fretted over a recession and predicted a rough first half followed by a second-half recovery on the back of the Federal Reserve’s pivot. Most ended up blindsided by the resilience of the US economy and profit growth, as well as by the artificial intelligence-driven rally in big tech stocks. Read more: Wall Street Soothsayers Are Bewildered About What’s Next The S&P 500 ended up rallying 16% in the first half of the year, the best return for the period since 2019. And while cooling inflation this week buoyed markets further, the outlook may be more challenging from here on: growing profit warnings and mixed data signal the worst of the economic damage may not be over. Bannister is betting on sectors such as industrials, materials, financials and transport to outperform in the second half, shifting focus away from Big Tech. While the US has so far avoided the recession feared by many in 2023, he sees it as a risk going into 2024, calling consensus earnings expectations next year too optimistic. “What we are doing is betting on equal weight outperforming cap-weight S&P, and cyclical value outperforming cyclical growth,” Bannister said.']\n",

The greenback will continue to ease at a moderate pace, boosting currencies under pressure from the Federal Reserve’s aggressive policy tightening, from emerging markets and the Swedish krona to the Japanese yen, per Goldman.  “The dollar has sold off sharply in response to cooler inflation and anticipation of a more patient Federal Reserve stance beyond July,” wrote Goldman analysts Michael Cahill, Isabella Rosenberg and Teresa Alves in a Thursday note. “We think this can extend because the same factors that weighed on yesterday’s report look likely to be softer still in coming months.” Data this week showed a material slowdown in US price pressures, casting doubts on additional interest-rate increases after an anticipated July hike. In turn, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index dropped nearly 1% Wednesday to hit the weakest since April last year — a downward move that’s continuing in Thursday trading.  The shift in the US dollar is rippling through global currency markets, after the Swiss franc rallied to the strongest since 2015 while the euro and the British pound rose to more than one-year highs.  Still, the dollar index lost about 5% in the two months after it reached its September peak while price pressures remain elevated — suggesting the fade-the-dollar trade isn’t without risks.  “We still maintain that overall dollar depreciation should be shallower and more subdued than after other peaks,” Goldman analysts wrote.   The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.5% Thursday. The Swedish krona was the best performer among the Group-of-10 currencies, gaining 1.7% against the greenback. The yen gained 0.3%.  “More tempered upside risks for the dollar should make a clearer case for pro-cyclical G-10 currencies that still have work to do on the domestic inflation picture,” the Goldman analysts wrote. “GBP is at the top of our list here, but NOK should also do well.” The Norwegian krone rose 1.2% and British pound added 0.9% against the dollar in Thursday trading in New York.

      "['A unit of state-owned China Minmetals Corp. is bracing for further delays in building a second pit at its troubled Las Bambas copper mine in Peru, while the military there continues to buffer the operation from protest disruptions.   A long-delayed project to mitigate depletion at the current pit was slated to begin in the second half of the year. That’s looking increasingly unlikely due to delays in negotiations with an indigenous community.  “We hope we can finish negotiations this year, but it’s too early in the process yet to know how fast it will go,” Troy Hey, who heads corporate relations at Hong Kong-listed MMG Ltd, said in an interview from Lima. “Once we get an agreement, it’s probably up to three months to get to mining.” Las Bambas, located in a remote part of the Peruvian Andes, is one of the world’s biggest and most troubled mines. It’s faced recurrent protests from indigenous communities since opening in 2016 at a cost of $10 billion. Blockades and other disruptions have exceeded 600 days in that span, interrupting shipments to smelters in China.  The mine, previously owned by Glencore Plc through its acquisition of Xstrata, can produce as much as 400,000 metric tons a year. But it’s repeatedly underperformed because of protests and declining ore quality. Opening the second pit would see Las Bambas run at full capacity. Without it, the mine will produce about 300,000 tons next year, assuming no disruptions, Hey said.  It’s currently operating with military protection. Tensions reached a peak a year ago when the Huancuire community entered Las Bambas and built a camp on land they had sold to the company for the second pit. Hey said Huancuire members had finally left the area, but that talks were not done yet. MMG is encouraged by new community leadership and is overhauling its approach to community relations, Hey said.  “We are in the best place we have been for a long time in terms of negotiations but it’s tough to see what time-frame it will be,” he said. Huancuire leadership turnover had stalled talks for more than six weeks but MMG hopes to restart negotiations next week, Hey said. Read More: Peru Seen Losing Title of No. 2 Copper Producer Soon to Congo Transporting semi-processed copper from Las Bambas to a seaport has long been the company’s biggest challenge. It uses a mostly unpaved road that traverses about 70 indigenous communities, many of which have long complained about insufficient financial benefit from mining.  President Dina Boluarte has managed to keep copper flowing since March by deploying military to the area. Her administration plans to keep soldiers there until further notice.  “Having police and military presence to keep things calm is not a long-term solution, though I think at the moment we greatly appreciate the support of the government to do that,” Hey said. Without the military, Las Bambas probably would have seen renewed blockades, he said. “It’s a chronic problem, and so if we do nothing differently we should expect to see the same outcome.”']\n",

      "['One Guatemalan presidential candidate suspended her campaign while the other called for protests after prosecutors raided the nation’s electoral authority on Thursday.  A day after the US government warned that the nation’s democracy is under threat, the Attorney General’s office extended its investigation into one of the two parties contesting the presidential runoff. Prosecutors said via Twitter that its agents are collecting evidence from the voter registry. The raid adds to uncertainty over the upcoming Aug. 20 vote. Irma Palencia, the head of the electoral authority, told local radio station Emisoras Unidas that she was “surprised and worried” by the raid.  The electoral authority on Wednesday certified the results of the June 25 vote for president, and confirmed that former first lady Sandra Torres would face former diplomat Bernardo Arévalo next month.  But a prosecutor stirred uncertainty about the runoff by alleging irregularities by Arévalo’s party Semilla.  Read more: Guatemala Confirms Election Result as Prosecutors Stoke Doubts The prosecutor, Rafael Curruchiche, said Semilla falsified signatures on paperwork when registering as a party in 2018, and that his office found signs of as many as 5,000 fake signatures. He said Semilla paid fines for some of the falsified signatures this year, but did not report where the money to pay the fines came from, which he said constitutes money laundering.  Arévalo called for protests on Thursday in front of the Attorney General’s Office and said he will file a formal complaint with prosecutors over their behaviour. Torres said Thursday she is suspending her campaign in solidarity with Arévalo.  On Wednesday, Brian Nichols, US assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, said Washington is “deeply concerned” by “new threats to Guatemala’s electoral democracy” from prosecutors. Arévalo, who campaigned against corruption, defied polls to unexpectedly win a place in the second round. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and says the nation’s traditional political class is conspiring to keep him out of office.  A lobby group representing the nation’s business leaders, CACIF, called on the government to respect the election results and cited an election law which prohibits the banning of a political party when an election is in progress.   The nation’s dollar bonds due 2033 were little changed amid the turmoil, gaining 0.1 cent to 80.97 cents on the dollar. ']\n",

The company has revised the start of contract cargoes from its Calcasieu Pass LNG plant to late 2024, extending a previous delay by almost a year, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the information is private.  That shipment date would give Calcasieu Pass the longest commissioning period for any US LNG project. The company first commissioned the plant in early 2022. Venture Global didn’t respond to requests for comment. The company previously said that the producer remains in full compliance with its long-term contracts, including on timing.  While the Calcasieu Pass plant in Louisiana has been steadily shipping LNG since March 2022, it has yet to enter commercial operations, citing ongoing plant issues with its steam generators. Until that work is done and commercial operations begin, Venture Global isn’t obligated to supply shipments to the fuel to long-term customers at contracted prices. The project will make 10 million tons of LNG per year.  Instead, the company can sell the fuel at higher spot market rates. Buyers, including Shell Plc and Italian utility Edison, have lodged arbitration cases against Venture Global for failing to supply contracted shipments, the people said. Edison confirmed its case.  Other long-term customers at Calcasieu Pass include BP Plc, Galp Energia SGPS SA, Repsol SA and Polish company PKN ORLEN.

      "['For more than three years, about 200 Chinese companies whose shares trade in the US have faced the prospect of being delisted from New York exchanges if American regulators are blocked from fully reviewing their audit documents. The companies, including big names such as JD.com Inc. and Baidu Inc., said Chinese national security law prohibited them from turning over the work papers. A 2022 agreement between Beijing and Washington cleared the way for US inspections of the audits to begin.  The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enacted after the Enron Corp. accounting scandal, required that publicly traded companies make their audit work papers available for inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB. While more than 50 jurisdictions worked with the board to allow the reviews, only two — China and Hong Kong — didn’t, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. That discrepancy drew attention when Chinese chain Luckin Coffee Inc., which was listed on Nasdaq, was found to have intentionally fabricated a chunk of its 2019 revenue.  In 2020, Congress passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), which says companies can’t trade on US exchanges if American inspectors can’t review their audits. In 2022, SEC began listing the names of companies that could be kicked off American exchanges. They included giants like Alibaba, JD.com, Pinduoduo Inc. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. A law passed in the final days of 2022 sped up the time frame, to two years instead of three, for kicking noncompliant companies off the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. The situation has improved markedly over the past year and is arguably one of the few bright spots in an otherwise icy relationship between the world’s two-biggest economies. The near-term threat of delistings ebbed in August 2022 when American and Chinese authorities signed a deal to let officials to start reviewing audit documents of Chinese businesses that trade in the US. Both sides heralded the accord as a major step. The first audit inspection reports, released in MayBloomberg Terminal by the PCAOB, found that affiliates of two US Big Four accounting firm — KPMG’s affiliate in China and PricewaterhouseCoopers’s affiliate in Hong Kong — fell short in vetting their clients’ accounting or internal controls in seven of eight instances. In June, the PCAOB sent a team to Hong Kong to review audit reports of some of the most high-profile Chinese names listed in the US, including Tencent Music Entertainment Group, Didi Global Inc. and NetEase Inc.  Critics say Chinese companies enjoy the trading privileges of a market economy — including access to US stock exchanges — while receiving government support and operating in an opaque system. In addition to inspecting audits, the HFCAA requires foreign companies to disclose if they’re controlled by a government. The SEC is also demanding that investors receive more information about the structure and risks associated with shell companies — known as variable interest entities, or VIEs — that Chinese companies use to list shares in New York. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said that more than 250 companies already trading will face similar requirements.  Major private firms like Alibaba could probably argue that they are not, although others with substantial state ownership may have a harder time. The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which reports to Congress, has noted that five Chinese state-owned enterprises said in August 2022 that they would voluntarily delist from NYSE.  They’re attracted by the much bigger and less volatile pool of capital, which can potentially be tapped much faster. Dozens of firms pulled planned initial public offerings in 2021 after Chinese regulators tightened listing requirements to protect the retail investors who dominate stock trading, as opposed to the institutional investors and mutual-fund base active in the US. And for a time, the Hong Kong exchange had a ban on dual-class shares, which are used by tech entrepreneurs to keep control of their startups after going public in the US. It was relaxed in 2018, prompting big listings from Alibaba, Meituan and Xiaomi Corp. ']\n",

Under the terms of a deal to be announced soon, Galimzhan Yessenov will increase his stake in First Heartland Jusan Bank to almost 100% from near 20%, the people said, declining to be identified as the information isn’t public. The seller is Jusan Technologies, a UK-based company that was linked to a foundation set up by Nazarbayev. In response to a Bloomberg query, Jusan Bank confirmed that “a constructive settlement” had been reached but provided no further details. The standoff has been playing out against the backdrop of efforts by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to consolidate his control over the $226 billion economy following the signingBloomberg Terminal of a law on clawing back assets the government deems illegally obtained.  In the aftermath of the worst riots in the history of independent Kazakhstan a year and a half ago, Tokayev moved to sideline many allies and family members of his predecessor Nazarbayev and vowed to take on the country’s entrenched oligarchs. The coming settlement will resolve a legal battle that’s simmered for about five months since Kazakh prosecutors started proceedings to stop the transfer of the bank’s ownership to Jusan Technologies. The US parent company of Jusan Technologies then counter-sued the Kazakh government, accusing it in a federal lawsuitBloomberg Terminal in Nevada of attempting to seize control of assets worth over $1.5 billion. Yessenov earlier sued Jusan Technologies and its subsidiaries over the value of his stake in the bank and dividend payouts he said he was owed. Jusan Bank and its parent company have denied “any affiliationBloomberg Terminal” with Nazarbayev or members of his family.  Yessenov will pay for assets that also include minority stakes in the country’s biggest mobile operator and state-run Kazakhtelecom, the people said, without specifying the amount. As part of the Jusan deal, the parties agreed to revise upward the value of Yessenov’s stake, acquired after his ATF Bank mergedBloomberg Terminal with Jusan, the people said. The settlement includes compensation for unpaid dividends for Yessenov and factors in the difference in the valuation of his stake, they said.  Jusan has paidBloomberg Terminal more than $500 million in dividends after receiving over $3 billion in state support in 2018 and 2019 as part of a bailoutBloomberg Terminal that was among the country’s biggest in recent years. Defaults and debt restructurings by Kazakh banks have forced Nazarbayev’s government to provide at least $18 billion in state aid going back more than a decade.  In return for payments to Jusan Technologies, Yessenov gets control of the bank’s Kazakh parent, the people said. Under the terms, Jusan Technologies will also offload to Yessenov a stake of about 9% in Kazakhtelecom and a 15% shareholding in mobile operator Kcell, they said.  The deal is conditional on almost all of Yessenov’s money ending up with a Kazakh university and schools supported by the New Generation Foundation, which replaced the Nazarbayev Fund in Jusan’s group ownership restructure in 2021, according to the people. A spokeswoman for Yessenov declined to comment. No one answered calls to the public relations agency for Jysan Holding, a parent for Jusan Technologies, and it didn’t immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. No one was also available to comment at the Justice Ministry, which represents the Kazakh government in courts abroad, and it didn’t immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.  “We are very encouraged that a constructive settlement has been reached that enables the bank to to capitalize on great opportunities for growth,” Jusan Bank’s press service said. “It is a positive outcome for all parties.”']\n",

The private equity owners of McDonald’s Corp.’s operations in China are approaching firms including Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co. for a $4 billion stake sale, people familiar with the matter have said. Deliberations are still at an early stage, and it’s unclear which funds will ultimately decide to participate in the Syngenta offering, the people said.

The Palo Alto, California-based firm will use money from the fund to continue to invest in companies that develop AI tools with a business use case, founding partner Peter Wagner said in an interview.  While VC firms have been interested in AI for years, momentum has accelerated since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT language tool gripped public attention, according to Wagner. Wagner said it is becoming “increasingly difficult to find anything interesting to do in B2B technology that isn’t making use of AI in an important and fundamental way.” There have been a string of AI-related mergers and acquisitions in recent weeks, most notably Databricks Inc.’s purchase of generative AI platform MosaicML for $1.3 billion, with predictions of more to come from tech industry executives.  Wing, which was an early backer of $59 billion cloud-computing firm Snowflake Inc., has already invested in a number of AI companies including language tool Copy.ai, software provider Gong and data processor Pinecone. Founded in 2013 by Sequoia Capital and Accel alumni, Wing focuses on writing checks for the seed and Series A stages of startups’ funding. The firm raised $450 million for its third fund in 2020.

      "['The world’s largest agricultural commodities trader is behind a sharp move that upended the London cocoa market. Cargill Inc. has been building a dominant position in the market since earlier this year, resorting to the ICE Futures Europe exchange to source large amounts of the key chocolate ingredient, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the information is private. Buying more beans through the futures market this month would further cement that position. The trade comes as two years of shortages dramatically reduced stockpiles, with a measure of reserves relative to consumption falling to the lowest level in almost four decades. Supplies in the physical market are so tight that attracting cocoa beans to be delivered through the exchange requires a large premium. That’s exactly what happened in this case. Cargill’s move left traders who sold futures scrambling to find enough cocoa to deliver when July futures expire on Friday. That sent the July contract to a premium of as much as £240 ($314) a ton to September. Cargill declined to comment. The trade, albeit different, is the biggest since hedge fund manager Armajaro Asset Management LLP’s Anthony Ward tried to corner the market more than a decade ago, taking one of the largest-ever deliveries of cocoa in London. The so-called squeeze, which earned him the nickname “Chocfinger,” sent July futures to an even bigger premium to September. Much has changed in the market since those days. Ivory Coast and Ghana now sell most of their crop before harvest starts, leaving few sales to be done in the spot months. That means earlier-dated contracts tend to see less selling pressure than forward ones. The top producers also charge $400 a ton over the futures price for their beans. The fee was introduced a few years ago to boost farmer income in a cartel-like move that has led to them to be dubbed the OPEC of cocoa. All of that means beans that back exchange contracts tend to be the cheapest around. For more to be brought to the bourse for delivery, the price of earlier dated contracts has to rise to a level that’s similar to what’s being charged in the physical market.  There may be several reasons why Cargill is buying cocoa through the exchange. The Minneapolis-based company is the world’s second-largest processor and it may need the beans to keep its European factories running. Global cocoa production has already fallen short of demand for two consecutive years, depressing the global stocks-to-use ratio to 32.2%, the lowest since the 1984-85 season, according to the International Cocoa Organization. To make matters worse, an El Nino weather pattern is currently threatening to disrupt supplies from the next crop in West Africa.   Cargill took delivery of almost 140,000 tons of cocoa when the March and May contracts expired in London, according to people familiar with the deals and exchange data. That’s about the size of the global deficit the ICCO has forecast for the current season that ends in September. But the trader also lost some beans due to a fire at a Vollers Group GmbH warehouse in Amsterdam in April, people familiar with the matter said.  It’s unclear how much cocoa Cargill could buy this month, if any. The July contracts premium has all but vanished quickly in the past four days, and exchange data currently points to a small delivery of about 7,000 metric tons. In 2020, Hershey Co. also bought a large amount of cocoa through the exchange, a move that rattled the New York market. Back then, the move sent December futures to a huge premium to the next futures contract.']\n",

      "['To money managers, bonds tied to a failed airport project in Mexico increasingly look like a sure thing.  The Mexico City Airport Trust bonds raised money starting in 2016 to build a new airport serving the nation’s capital, a project that President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador canceled in 2018. But the securities are backed by passenger fees from the existing Benito Juarez International Airport.  Those fees have been rising as international air travel rebounds, helping the so-called Mexcat 30-year bonds surge by around 50% since late September. That makes them the best-performing Mexican corporate notes over that period, accounting for both price changes and interest payments. The spread on the bonds due 2047 relative to comparable dollar-denominated Mexican government debt has narrowed to its lowest since issuance.  The bonds have jumped further over the past month, after AMLO said he wants the navy to take over operation of the airport.  The comment has made investors hopeful that Mexico will start to buy back some of the $4.2 billion total of bonds tied to the project, or offer a full guarantee to replace the payments based on passenger fees, said Aaron Gifford, an emerging-market sovereign debt analyst at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. A guarantee could be riskier for the government, since it could lead to holdouts, while an early repurchase would be more promising, he said.  “I think the government has the desire and ability to do the transaction, so I think there’s more upside in the bonds,” Gifford said. The airport has been generating more fee income that is earmarked for buying back debt. Even still, the precise steps that the government takes next are hard to forecast, said BBVA credit strategist George Ordonez. He had recommended going overweight in the airport bonds last month. After the latest rally, he said investors were likely looking to take profits in the absence of a clear plan from the government. “With most investors, there’s confusion,” Ordonez said.  Buying back the bonds will probably force Mexico to pay more than face value given provisions in the debt that require the nation to make investors whole for lost yield if the debts are repurchased, T. Rowe Price’s Gifford said.  Mexico City Airport bonds with a 5.5% coupon due 2047 traded on Thursday at a spread of about 251 basis points over US Treasuries, after starting the year closer to 365 basis points. They yield around 6.44%.   AMLO is looking to hand over control of the airport as part of a move to expand the military’s oversight of key parts of the nation’s infrastructure. The president didn’t provide a timeline when he was discussing the plan last month. Other officials have been signaling that the navy is reluctant to take over as long as fees from the airport are going to bondholders, which may force the government to think about how to restructure or retire the debt.  When the existing airport generates more passenger fee income than necessary to pay operating expenses, up to $200 million per year can be set aside to pay down principal. The trust’s principal accumulation account has likely risen to more than $750 million by the end of June, from $671 million at the end of last year, according to BBVA’s Ordonez.  Those funds are earmarked for eventual buybacks, said Aayush Sonthalia, a portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income, who holds the debt. “We have found this bond quite attractive over the last few quarters,” he said. “There’s a lot of cash being trapped in the structure and they will be required to use that to retire the principal.”   Passenger volume at the airport has been rising this year, up about 11% for 2023 through the end of May. International air travel revenues have broadly been surging in 2023 due to pent-up demand after the pandemic. The airline industry’s main global trade group last month doubled its estimates for net profits for carriers, citing factors including growing demand in North America.    Some investors get comfort from the legal documents for the airport bond, which offer clear covenants and spell out investors’ safeguards. The government is unlikely to take any steps for the global bond that could trigger a default, said Alejandro Di Bernardo, a portfolio manager at Jupiter Asset Management. Doing so could undermine other Mexican quasi-sovereign credits, like state-run oil company Pemex, he said.  “Whatever the Mexican government offers to investors, we don’t think it’s going to deviate too much from something reasonable,” he said.']\n",

      "['With the S&P 500 up 25% in nine months and sitting at its best level since April 2022, people want to know: is an all-time high next? John Flood, a partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., thinks so. “For first time in 2023 we are currently being asked by multiple clients if we think the S&P 500 is now on track to clock an ATH before year end,” Flood wrote in a note to clients Wednesday after a soft reading in the consumer price index lifted the equity benchmark as much as 1.1%. “I am going with a yes on this.”   Getting there would require an extension of a rally that has already shocked most on Wall Street amid better-than-expected economic growth and corporate earnings. The index made a record 4,796.56 in January 2022, about 7% above the last close. Flood’s optimism is at odds with the majority of Wall Street strategists who keep hanging on their bearish view that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening will lead to an economic slowdown if not an outright recession. Their average year-end targetBloomberg Terminal, as compiled by Bloomberg in mid-June, shows the S&P 500 will fall about 8% by December — the worst second-half outlook since at least 1999. Stocks have recovered all their losses since the Fed began raising interest rates 16 months ago, with the S&P 500 now trading roughly 3% above where it was at the start of the hiking cycle.  Flood is among a small but growing group of equity bulls that set eyes for new highs. Ed Yardeni, an early cheerleader of this bull run who has a year-end target of 4,600, says he will probably raise the forecast to 4,800, “depending on how things are shaping up.” The 4,600 projection “looked delusional earlier this year, I have to admit, but it’s worked out awfully well,” the president of Yardeni Research said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.   Second-quarter reporting season, due to kick offBloomberg Terminal unofficially by banks Friday, is likely to bolster equities, as the forecast 9% profit dropBloomberg Terminal sets what Flood calls “another low bar” for corporate America to clear. While the period likely marks the trough of this earnings slowdown, he notes that excluding the drag from energy, growth already bottomed in the fourth quarter of last year, coinciding with the market’s nadir.  “The bar for this period is exceptionally low (again),” Flood wrote. It’s “a positive signal for stocks.” ']\n",

      "['Bank of America Corp. won a Texas city’s bond deal on Wednesday, a sign that the nation’s largest municipal underwriter plans to revive its public-finance business in the state after an absence of almost two years. The bank won a $161 million offering in a competitive auction by the city of Frisco, its first time to handle a deal for a Texas city or local government since a GOP-backed law related to the firearms industry took effect in September 2021, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The bank suspended its work in the state late that year after the enactment of the law, which restricted Texas governments’ work with companies that “discriminate” against firearm entities.  Bank of America doesn’t lend to companies that make assault-style guns used for non-military purposes. The bank’s law firm sent a letter to the Texas Attorney General’s Office in May saying that the bank believes it complies with the 2021 measure and that it intends to resume working with public clients in Texas.  It’s unclear whether Bank of America has gotten a nod from the Attorney General’s Office, which oversees bond sales in the state. Austin Kinghorn, Texas associate deputy attorney general for legal counsel, sent the bank’s law firm dozens of questions about its gun industry policies in a June 26 letter.  Erin Mynatt, a spokesperson for Frisco, said in an emailed statement that the city received seven bids from banks on the sale. Bank of America offered a true interest cost of 3.52%, whereas the next-closest bidder, JPMorgan Chase & Co., offered a true interest cost of 3.57%, according to the city. Bank of America provided a deposit, so if it can’t close on the bonds the city can keep the money, according to Mynatt’s statement.  “We are aware that BoA has follow-up questions with the state attorney general to address concerns,” Frisco’s statement said. “We plan to close the sale quickly and do have their good faith check, but we are not concerned.” A spokesperson for Bank of America said the company didn’t have an immediate comment. The Texas Attorney General’s Office didn’t respond to an email and phone call requesting comment. In May, the bank underwrote an offering by a Texas municipal utility district, which provide utility services.  A law firm representing Bank of America previously said in a letter to the attorney general’s office that the bank can provide written verifications that it complies with the law.   “BoA serves companies and associations involved with the firearms industry,” the letter said. “BoA’s risk-based framework does not discriminate against, or prevent BoA from doing business with, any firearm entity or firearm trade association ‘based solely on its status as a firearm entity or firearm trade association’ without a traditional business purpose.”  Related: BofA’s Return to Texas Muni Market Stalled by More Gun Questions']\n",

      "['Private equity firm Carlyle Group is said to be leaning toward handing over portfolio company Praesidiad Group Ltd. to a group of creditors as part of a debt restructuring. The UK-headquartered security systems company and its creditors have been locked in negotiations over how to deal with debt coming due next year, with the most likely scenario being a lender takeover of the firm, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The ad hoc group of creditors comprises Alcentra, Bain Capital Credit, Capital Four and Cheyne, they said.  Despite the company’s operational turnaround in recent years, Praesidiad has faced headwinds from the rise in raw material prices such as steel and a slowdown in the European construction sector. That, combined with higher interest rates, makes it challenging to refinance its debt in full, the people said. No final decisions have been made. Representatives for Praesidiad, Carlyle, Alcentra, Capital Four and Cheyne declined to comment. Bain didn’t respond to a request for comment. Praesidiad’s liabilities include €290 million of term loans due in October 2024 and an €80 million revolving credit facility, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In addition, it has $36 million of dollar-denominated term loans.  The debt incurred by Praesidiad was part of Carlyle’s leveraged buyout in late 2017. In 2019, the private equity firm brought in a new management team led by Dino Koutrouki as chief executive officer to focus on performance improvement.  The creditors are being advised by Moelis & Co. and law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, while the company is working with bankers at Houlihan Lokey Inc. and lawyers at Linkaters LLP, said the people.  Representatives for Houlihan Lokey and Moelis declined to comment. Simpson Thacher and Linkaters didn’t respond to requests for comment. Praesidiad will require a special license from the UK’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) to do a debt restructuring deal in the country, because the company counts Gazprombank JSC, currently under sanctions in the UK, among its lenders, according to some of the people familiar with the matter. Representatives for Gazprombank and OFSI didn’t respond to requests for comment. Getting that green light may delay the completion of the transaction. The third-largest Russian lender has an exposure of less than €20 million to Praesidiad. Gazprombank is not currently sanctioned by the European Union.']\n",

That’s at least one scenario envisioned by the bank after October, which it acknowledges is a tricky period to forecast. At the other extreme, prices could surge to €100 if Europe freezes for a prolonged period and renewables don’t provide sufficient relief. Using a weighted average, they’re more likely to be around €45, the analysts said. The range in the outlook is a reminder that the region is still finding its footing as it recovers from a historic energy crisis. Mild weather helped Europe survive the past winter without any major supply interruptions, despite severely curtailed pipeline flows from Russia. It may not get a similar break this year. Dutch front-month gas futures, Europe’s benchmark, have fluctuated near €30 a megawatt-hour this week. That’s a fraction of the peak reached last year, but still relatively high as both supply and demand risks remain. The contract averaged about €15 in late 2020, when the pandemic sapped fuel consumption. For the moment, some weather models suggest a high probability of a mild winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Temperatures are already soaring to record levels, amplified by climate change and an El Niño pattern of warmer water in the Pacific Ocean.

The UK energy giant is working with advisers to study a range of possibilities that could also include separating the business into a more independent unit, the people said. It’s approached a number of international investors to gauge their interest in buying a stake, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.  The deliberations come as Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan focuses the company’s investments on fossil fuels in a bid to increase shareholder returns and narrow the valuation gap with Shell’s US peers.  Discussions are still at an early stage, and there’s no certainty they will lead to a transaction, the people said. Shell may also consider introducing outside investors into some other operations such as its downstream assets, one of the people said.  A representative for Shell declined to comment beyond a capital markets day presentation in June, when the company flagged plans to divest certain power assets through 2025, but also make selective investments in the business.  If a deal does happen, it could be a significant shift in Shell’s green strategy. The oil major has spent more than two decades trying to figure out just how big of a player it wants to be in renewables. Over the years, some CEOs have set targets for low-carbon alternatives to oil and gas, only for their successors to focus more squarely on the fuels that drive most of the company’s profits, but also cause climate change.  It could also be seen as a concession to activist investor Dan Loeb, whose Third Point LLC fund built up a significant stake in Shell in 2021 and urged previous CEO Ben van Beurden to break off its natural gas and renewables operations into a standalone business. There is a precedent for such a move — Italian oil giant Eni SpA has separated its renewable-energy assets into a separate entity called Plenitude.  Read more: Shell’s Plan to Fight Climate Change Is Missing Some Key Details Shell’s approach in recent years was emblematic of the European oil majors’ efforts to position their businesses for a world that cuts carbon emissions and relies less on fossil fuels in the coming years. It’s been a stark contrast to their US peers Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., which have stuck more closely to their core businesses of oil and gas.  Under van Beurden, Shell rapidly grew its green power business and briefly sought to become the world’s biggest electricity producer. The company’s portfolio, which had 6.4 gigawatts in operation or development at the end of last year, includes offshore and onshore wind farms in Europe and the US. It recently acquired Indian solar developer Sprng Energy, Danish biofuels producer Nature Energy and American renewable power company Savion.  So far investors have rewarded the US oil majors’ strategy, pushing their valuations far above their European competitors. Shell’s renewable-power business has come under pressure as Sawan pursues what he’s called a “ruthless” approach to prioritizing returns, meaning the unit has to generate profits in addition to cutting the company’s carbon footprint. While Sawan said he will continue to invest in renewable power, he’s vowed to be more selective and only pursue projects that create sufficient value.  As Shell’s approach to green power has shifted at the top, some executives in the business have departed. Renewable-power boss Thomas Brostrom quit to pursue another job. Shell’s UK head of offshore wind, Melissa Read, also left the company.']\n",

World oil consumption will climb by 2.2 million barrels a day next year to reach 104.3 million a day, the organization said on Thursday in its first detailed assessment of 2024. That’s the double the growth rate projected by the International Energy Agency, which advises consuming nations. The demand increase would outstrip the projected boost in supply from outside the cartel, pushing the world’s daily appetite for OPEC’s crude to 30.2 million barrels — or roughly 2 million barrels more than it pumped last month. That could allow the group to ease production constraints it’s making this year to shore up prices. Saudi Arabia and its partners have curbed output to balance markets amid a faltering global economy and unexpectedly robust supplies from exporters including Iran and Russia, both of which are both part of a wider alliance known as OPEC+. Oil prices climbed above $80 a barrel in London on Wednesday for the first time in two months as those supply curbs, which include extra unilateral cuts by the Saudis in July and August, tighten markets. Demand in China also appears robust despite shaky economic indicators.  The Paris-based IEA, which also released its latest outlook on Thursday, sees demand growing by 1.1 million barrels a day next year. The expansion in oil consumption will be limited by improving fuel efficiency and the burgeoning popularity of electric vehicles, the agency said.  The 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped an average of 28.2 million barrels a day in June, fractionally more than the previous month, according to the report.  The 23-nation OPEC+ alliance is formally due to hold a monitoring meeting next month, though no date has yet been set. The coalition is scheduled to have a full ministerial meeting on Nov. 26. ']\n",

      "['Some energy-focused buyout firms are dialing back their fundraising ambitions as institutional investors shy away from fossil fuels. EnCap Investments and NGP Energy Capital Management — two of the most active buyout firms in the oil patch — are in the market with new funds that are smaller than their last pools of capital, as pension funds, university endowments, insurance companies and other investors retreat from the space. Some have faced scrutiny from politicians and activists for supporting oil and gas. Others have been burned by oil price slumps in the past. Their ability to commit capital has also been tied by fewer exits amid market volatility and valuation differences. “Over the past couple years, a lot of limited partners started to prioritize ESG, and the pool of capital looking at traditional oil and gas sponsors has shrunk,” Shubi Arora, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, said.  The smaller funds underscore how oil-and-gas buyout firms are facing one of the toughest fundraising environments in years as interest rates rise and the economy slows. Institutional investors have run out of new capital to allocate to energy after a sharp drop in public equities. EnCap is targeting $4 billion for its 12th flagship fund, or about 43% less than it raised for its previous $7 billion fund, according to people with knowledge of the situation. NGP aims to raise $2.5 billion for its latest flagship fund, compared to the $4.3 billion raised in its predecessor fund, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the details aren’t public.  Representatives at EnCap and NGP declined to comment.  The source of big money powering the oil patch has shifted dramatically. Oil and gas producers have been producing massive cash flows in the past two years. In many cases they can self-finance now and don’t need outside capital. That’s a major change from before the Covid-19 shakeout. Money managers are scarred by the previous era of shale growth, which incinerated many tens of billions of dollars in private equity funding. With fundraising slowing, energy buyout firms are branching out to other pockets of capital. Some are taking advantage of continuation funds, which allow them to move assets into new vehicles while providing a liquidity option for existing investors. “It brings in new money and also allows existing investors to stay in if they want to,” said Leor Landa, head of investment management at Davis Polk & Wardwell. “It’s a way to extend the timelines of investments for general partners.” Separately managed accounts are gaining popularity too, as they offer a tailored investment strategy based on an investor’s portfolio management needs and risk appetite.  “It’s a pretty attractive product for sponsors who don’t want to go out in a difficult fundraising market to still get that capital and find good deals,” said Matt Nadworny, founding partner of Kirkland & Ellis’s investment fund practice groups in Houston and Dallas. And as banks pull back from funding small to mid-sized oil and gas companies, some private equity firms are muscling into private credit, said Arora, who is advising several clients on expanding into this space. Private credit has become the new hot thing on Wall Street, sidestepping banks to help finance acquisitions while enjoying less regulatory oversight. In June, global commodities powerhouse Vitol SA and private equity firm Riverstone Holdings said they are teaming upBloomberg Terminal to provide debt and acquisition funding to oil and gas companies in North America.  “We see limited competition from banks or other direct lenders, and the ability to provide well collateralized loans to strongly capitalized companies is as good as we’ve seen in the last decade,” Riverstone Credit Partners told Bloomberg. While traditional energy private equity dollars shrink, others are filling the void. Family offices are increasingly interested in getting into energy transition investments to diversify their portfolios. Some are also deploying cash in the minerals sector, which offers a steady stream of ‘mailbox money’ without having to worry about production cost, industry observers said. Asset managers are also jumping into the fray, taking a contrarian approach that they could scoop up quality assets with less competition in the down cycle, they said.  Elliott Investment Management, a hedge fund and activist investor led by billionaire Paul Singer, generated a fast return on Eagle Ford basin operator Validus Energy, which was sold to Devon Energy for $1.8 billion in 2022, about 18 months after Validus acquired those assets from Ovintiv Inc. for $880 million. A representative at Elliott declined to comment. “The energy sector is very capital intensive, so in almost all cases we will continue to see money flowing in,” said Kaam Sahely, a partner at Vinson & Elkins, who expects more investor appetite for hydrogen, ammonia and sustainable fuels. “To the extent that returns are strong, the capital for traditional energy is there, it is just coming into the market in slightly different ways.”']\n",

      "['An ESG fund manager that shuns investing in nations classified as unfree is having one of his best years after the strategy helped him dodge meltdowns in a number of emerging markets. Thierry Larose, Zurich-based manager of Vontobel’s $330 million sustainable emerging-market local-currency bond fund, tracks rankings from Washington-based Freedom House and blacklists any countries ranked “not free.” That leaves one third of the emerging market universe off limits, including some of the largest countries in it. Freedom House’s rankings of 210 countries and territories take into account elections, freedom of expression and rule of law. Among countries ranked “not free” are China, Russia, Egypt, Turkey and Thailand. The fund’s strategy is based on the assertion that autocratic regimes tend to have more instability over the long term because they lack the checks and balances typically present in stronger democracies. “This filtering framework has helped us a lot,” said Larose, who co-manages the fund with Carl Vermassen for family-owned Vontobel Asset Management, which has $230 billion under management. “If you don’t have minimum democracy or freedom in a specific country, the chances are high that the institutions of the country will be weaker, implying higher uncertainty on all levels, and for financial markets, higher probability of volatility and erratic returns.” The fund’s rule of not financing authoritarian regimes has saved it from meltdown in Russia after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and losses in Egypt and Turkey. Combined with this year’s rally in Latin America’s democracies, that’s put it ahead of 97% of more than 5,000 fixed-income emerging-market funds tracked by Bloomberg. Vontobel’s fund has generated 17% total returns in US dollar terms over a year, compared with 4% on the Bloomberg benchmark EM local debt index. Russia, once an favorite of investors in emerging markets, was kicked out of benchmark EM indexes and heavily sanctioned by the US and Europe. Turkey, ranked “not free” by Freedom House for suppressing dissent and limiting public discourse, topped local emerging-market debt losses this year with a nearly 40% plunge. Egypt, where it says meaningful opposition is virtually nonexistent, lost 18%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  On the other hand, three of the top five performers this year  — Colombia, Brazil and Poland — are rated as “free,” while two others — Hungary and Mexico, were ranked “partly free” by the think tank’s annual Freedom in the World report. Larose allows investment in “partly free” countries and while there may be differences of opinion about the designations, “we prefer to rely on rankings provided by a third party for objectivity,” he said. “You cannot be too strict if you want to invest in emerging markets,” he said. “If you’d like full democracies, then you end up with a portfolio with Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland.” While autocracies often try hard to avoid a default in hard-currency debt that could destabilize their regimes and risk seizing of international assets by US courts, the risk set is different for local debt. “Our conviction is that if there is not enough freedom and democracy, there is a higher risk that non-pragmatic and irresponsible decisions will be taken leading to more uncertainty and eventually more asset volatility,” he said. “Those countries are more prone not to take orthodox, pragmatic measures and historically have more often defaulted on their local debt than free or partly free countries.” EM countries that should benefit the most from falling US rates and robust China demand are mostly ranked free, Larose added. His basket of favorites includes bonds of South Korea, Malaysia, Czech Republic, Israel, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico.  His strategy hasn’t always worked, though. In 2019 he underperformed peers when Egypt and Russia handed investors top returns, while Argentina and Chile had the biggest losses. Over the longer run, the fund has outperformed 75% of peers over the last five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “We are happy use this strategy as we see it as a safeguard,” he said. “Sometimes you will miss out but on average it is beneficial.”']\n",

      "['Pioneering quant investor Dimensional Fund Advisors has applied for a new fund structure that would give it a powerful tax advantage enjoyed exclusively by Vanguard Group for more than 20 years. The David Booth-founded firm wants to create ETFs as a share class of its mutual funds, according to a Thursday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That model would essentially mean the money manager can port the tax efficiency of the ETF wrapper into many of its established products. The structure was pioneered by Vanguard in 2001. Cannily, the Jack Bogle-founded giant quickly established a patent, meaning rivals would have to agree a license with the firm to follow suit. That patent expired in May. A mood change at the SEC in subsequent years threw up another, more formidable barrier. The regulator must grant exemptive relief from existing rules before the structure can be applied, but it has become concerned that the model sees ETF holders subsidizing mutual-fund holders.  VanEck applied to offer ETF share classes through 2012 and 2015, but was never successful. Dimensional is at least the second firm to apply for relief this year, and there’s no deadline for Wall Street’s watchdog to respond.  “The timeline is a little bit uncertain and will be driven by what the SEC is prioritizing,” Gerard O’Reilly, Dimesional’s co-CEO and chief investment officer, said in a phone interview. “We’re hopeful that as we raise our voice, others in the industry will raise their voice and that will hopefully raise up the priority list for the SEC to look at ETF share classes.” Dimensional, which controls over $600 billion, started discussing ETF share classes of its mutual funds with SEC staff in 2019, O’Reilly said. Its use of the structure would differ to that of Vanguard, which only deploys the model in passive vehicles. While rules-based, most of Dimensional’s products are active. The firm was a late entrant to the ETF market with its first products launching in 2020, but it rapidly ramped up its presence using aggressive pricing and by converting nearly $40 billion of mutual-fund assets into the newer wrapper. The Austin, Texas-based asset manager is now the largest issuer of actively managed ETFs, with roughly $95 billion across its lineup, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The application lands as the rift between mutual fund outflows and ETF inflows continue to widen. Mutual funds are on track to bleed roughly $243 billion this year while ETFs have absorbed more than $200 billion, Investment Company Institute data compiled by Bloomberg show. That follows last year’s record $1.5 trillion gap.  As well as porting the ETF tax advantage to its mutual funds, the move would also deliver economies of scale and cost savings to Dimensional’s clients, O’Reilly said. But it all hinges on the SEC. “Step one has always been seeking exemptive relief,” he said. ']\n",

      "['French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire decided against raising the interest rate on hugely popular regulated savings accounts since the pace of inflation is slowing and pledged instead to guarantee it won’t fall for 18 months as he tries to balance the interests of households with investment costs. Following recommendations by Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, the payout on deposits in so-called Livret A accounts, which are used to finance social housing and urban development, will remain at 3%, Le Maire said on TF1 television Thursday. He cited “national economic interest reasons,” as a higher rate would have increased the cost of loans for individuals, small and mid-sized companies and the social housing sector. The decision impacts more than €540 billion ($603 billion) of savings and will apply from Aug. 1. “The number of social housing apartments drops by tens of thousands when we increase the cost of the Livret A,” he said. The rate is lower than the 4.1% the Bank of France would have recommended if it strictly applied a formula reflecting the average of short-term interest rates and consumer prices over the previous six months. The Livret A is a sensitive political issue in France at a time when households have faced the steepest inflation in four decades. At the same time, setting the level too high could be detrimental for France’s economic activity and growth, as other European countries do not have similar regulated savings plans, the central bank said in a statement Thursday. France to Raise Regulated Savings Rate as Inflation SurgesBloomberg Terminal French Inflation Pressures Ease as More Firms Cut Prices ECB Rate Hikes to End Soon at ‘High Plateau,’ Villeroy Says The rapid interest-rate increase of those accounts has impacted banks, which saw their cost of funding increase faster that the rates at which they could provide loans because of local mortgage lending rules. BNP Paribas SA only expects to reap the full benefits from higher rates in 2024 or 2025, the head of its French retail banking unit, Marguerite Berard, said in an interviewBloomberg Terminal with Bloomberg TV last week. The move is also threatening some insurers, whose customers are yanking their savings from accounts offering lower yields. In the first five months of this year, savers added more than €32 billion to the Livret A and LDD accounts, bringing total deposits to €542 billion. In a move to promote the Livret d’Epargne Populaire (LEP), which is aimed at households with more modest incomes, the government also kept the rate on those accounts at 6% for the next six months. While this represents a decrease from 6.1%, it is still higher than the 5.6% level the central bank would have recommended using the official formula. The government also announced the increase of the maximum amount that savers can place on LEP accounts from €7,700 to €10,000.']\n",

      "['Chinese President Xi Jinping finally appears to be extending an olive branch to private businesses battered in recent years by regulatory crackdowns and the world’s most restrictive Covid-19 policies. Officials have made a series of high-profile actions designed to telegraph the Chinese government’s backing for private firms, as the nation’s post-pandemic recovery risks being caught in a confidence trap. The Chinese leader has vowed to treat foreign investors better and called for greater opening up in recent weeks.  That mission has seen top officials roll out the red carpet for Elon Musk and other executives, draw a line under a tech crackdown that tanked the world’s biggest IPO, and even visit US-based Bain & Company’s Shanghai office in an apparent end to immediate worries about a probe into consultancies that spooked global investors. The Hang Seng Tech Index is on track for its best week this year following Beijing’s positive signals to the sector, although the gauge fellBloomberg Terminal about 0.2% Friday afternoon in Hong Kong.  China’s outreach comes as the nation’s post-pandemic recovery loses steam. The nation’s property market is showing signs of weakness, exports are shrinking and deflationary risks loom. Without “the lure of a rapidly growing economy,” China’s is finding it difficult to attract Western business, said Diana Choyleva, chief economist at Enodo Economics, a London-based research firm focused on China.  “Deflationary signs add to the impression of a troubled economy, making it harder for Beijing to recruit foreign capital to its efforts to counter US power,” she added. Perhaps China’s clearest signal of a shift in attitude toward the private sector was the praise heaped this week on tech companies, which have seen billions in market value wiped out due to Xi’s regulatory crackdown.  Chinese Premier Li Qiang called Internet firms the “trailblazers of the era” in a meeting on Wednesday with senior executives from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd. Meanwhile, the nation’s top economic planning agency praised major online platforms for supporting the nation’s technological innovation.  China’s efforts to convince investors the tech sector is open for business will be hampered by recent moves to insert Communist Party officials on boards and reduce big firms’ market shares, said Andrew Collier, a managing director at Orient Capital Research Inc. “Investors know there are sharp limits on growth for tech firms and, therefore, investing in them is highly risky,” he said. “There will be some opportunities for new listings and short-term trading options but the overall sector is no longer as attractive as it once was.” Still, the recent gestures at least imply authorities want to help create more jobs, bolster the real economy and drive the country’s competitive edge internationally, said Willer Chen, an analyst at Forsyth Barr Asia.  Another sign of encouragement for foreign investors: Chinese financial regulators have invited some of the world’s biggest investors to a symposium next week, Reuters reportedBloomberg Terminal, citing three unidentified people. China has already removed one major barrier to international business exchanges in the form of Covid controls that closed borders for three years. Members of China’s powerful Politburo met with Musk and Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., in May, signaling that the return of such executives is welcome. Business delegations from Japan and France have also visited this year, while the chief executive officers of Intel Corp. and Mastercard Inc., as well as senior representatives from Western Digital Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., are in China this week, according to an agenda seen by Bloomberg News.  Xi himself greeted US billionaire Bill Gates in Beijing last month calling him “the first American friend I’ve met in Beijing this year.” That warm message contrasted with the tougher meetings the Chinese leader and other officials had with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken days later. The world’s largest economies are locked in a trade war that’s seen both sides impose export controls. A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China earlier this year found that the Asian giant is no longer a top three investment priority for a majority of US firms, as geopolitical tensions simmer. There are some early signs frictions are easing. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said her meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing last week had put ties on a “surer footing.” Still, Yellen told her counterparts in Beijing that “coercive” and “punitive” actions against US firms in China were a major concern for businesses. Earlier this year, China conducted a series of raids on consultancy firms relied on by foreign investors. US consultancy Bain & Company said this week it had “warmly” welcomed a visit by top Shanghai officials days before Yellen’s trip. That marked officials’ first known visit to the firm since a wider probe of the industry over national security concerns. Despite China’s efforts Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis, said private sector “confidence has clearly not been restored.” She identified three main lingering problems: muted domestic demand, tighter national security regulations and the US and European Union stepping up exports controls to China.  “Being present in China is becoming a liability – rather than an asset – as far as global investors’ reactions are concerned,” she added. Tian Xuan, a Tsinghua University professor, said the government should formulate red lines so companies can operate with confidence in a frontpage article Wednesday in the state-run Securities Times. Distilling what was at stake for Xi’s government, Tian said: “What is the most important problem in the private economy now? It’s the lack of confidence among private entrepreneurs.”']\n",

Passenger traffic in India is above pre-pandemic levels despite fares being 30% higher, they said.  Akasa isn’t alone in stepping up hiring efforts — market leader IndiGo and Air India Ltd. plan to recruit thousands more staff, and both have blockbuster orders for hundreds of aircraft from Airbus SE and Boeing Co.

Akasa orderedBloomberg Terminal four more Boeing 737-8 aircraft last month, increasing its order book to 76 jets to be delivered by March 2027. Akasa will receive its 20th Boeing in a few days, meeting the government’s minimum fleet requirement for a carrier to start overseas operations, Dube said. He said the airline is “well capitalized,” dismissing concerns about funding after the death of billionaire founder Rakesh Jhunjhunwala in August. The airline, operated by SNV Aviation Pvt, hasn’t escaped the widespread supply-chain disruptions beleaguering the industry. Many of Akasa’s planes don’t have USB charging ports, which are supplied by third parties, Dube said. With deliveries starting to come in, the ports will be retrofitted on aircraft, requiring some assistance from Boeing, he said.']\n",

      "['The arrival of Meta Platforms Inc.’s Twitter challenger further complicates the investment case for social media firms Snap Inc. and Pinterest Inc., whose share price recoveries lag their larger rival. Facebook parent Meta is by far the dominant player in the sector, and that is extending to its stock this year. Shares have outperformed by leaps and bounds, with the rapid user growth of Threads the latest demonstration of a reach and scale that has made it a favorite among investors and analysts.  “It’s hard to make a case for owning Snap or Pinterest over Meta, since there’s no arguing that Meta is the strongest in the sector and the one that’s mostly likely to get stronger,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets.  While Threads is more of a direct competitor to Twitter — which has struggled since it was taken private by Elon Musk — than Snap or Pinterest, the service amassed 100 million users within a week of its launch, underlining how smaller platforms may struggle in the highly competitive market for online ads. Cowen upgradedBloomberg Terminal Meta on Thursday, citing the opportunity to monetize Threads. Amid gains in megacap tech stocks, Meta has soared 161% this year, second only to Nvidia Corp. among components of the Nasdaq 100 Index. Having since pulled back on costs that were exacerbated by its metaverse initiative, Meta has a lever for earnings growth that Snapchat parent Snap, and digital pin-board platform Pinterest, lack.  Meta rose 1.1% on Thursday, while Snap gained 2% and Pinterest was little changed. The Nasdaq 100 gained 0.8%. For Snap and Pinterest to be more compelling for investors, “they would need to compete with a better product idea than Meta,” said Woods. “I’m not sure what that would be, especially since Meta has this huge user base and incorporates features from its competitors.” Meta’s net earnings per share are expected to grow 40% this year, outpacing Snap and Pinterest. The degree to which Threads will drive growth remains to be seen, but Evercore ISI estimated it could generate about $8 billion in annual revenue over next two years — near the total analysts expect Snap to generate in that time, and above the consensus for Pinterest. Even with its year-to-date surge, Meta trades around 21 times forward earnings, below both its long-term average and the Nasdaq 100. The valuation represents a sizable discount to the multiples of both Snap and Pinterest. Meta Promises Threads Will Be Different. Cue the Skepticism “There’s a pretty nice setup for Meta given its valuation and growth prospects, and while it’s still early for Threads, the sign-ups say something about its scale and reach, which is what really sets it apart,” said Hanna Howard, research analyst at Gabelli Funds. “Something would really have to change for us to consider owning Snap or Pinterest instead.” Meta’s user base is several times larger than that of Snap or Pinterest, as is its average revenue per user. It had nearly 33% of the market share for global internet advertising revenue in 2022, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data; Snap had just 1.3% while Pinterest came in at 0.8%. Google parent Alphabet Inc. has a little more than half the market. Still, Freedom Capital’s Woods suggested that recent price action for Snap and Pinterest could represent something of a silver lining. “The fact that they aren’t making new lows could be a sign that the worst of the journey is over, and that things could be starting to turn around and improve. However, even if they look somewhat interesting, Meta is still the play over the long term.” More than 80% of Nasdaq 100 Index components are above their 50-day moving average, the highest percentage since December. This is a constructive signal for the market, reflecting both positive short-term momentum as well as broadening market breadth. ']\n",

      "['Shell Plc and seven Nigerian banks say a debt they’re owed by a domestic oil producer in the West African nation in relation to a 2015 asset sale has risen to about $2.6 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Aiteo Eastern E&P Co. bought a pipeline and an operating interest in one of the nation’s most-prized onshore oil blocks eight years ago for $2.4 billion. Zenith Bank Plc, Fidelity Bank Plc, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc and other local lenders loaned the company $1.5 billion to support the acquisition, while Shell – the seller of the permit – provided $504 million in funding. The parties have been locked in a legal dispute since late 2019, when the creditors notified Aiteo that it was in default.  The lenders’ position is that Aiteo’s outstanding debt has climbed to about $2.6 billion once interest, fees and penalties are included, said the people who asked not to be identified because the matter is the subject of litigation and arbitration, and discussions between the parties are confidential. The figure stood at $1.7 billion at the end of 2021 and $910 million a year earlier, according to statements made by the creditors in court and arbitration filings. In a 2019 court filing, Aiteo said it had already repaid $1.2 billion and denied being in default. The company didn’t respond to a request for comment. Shell and the other lenders either declined to comment or didn’t respond to emailed questions.

Production halted completely in February last year and only resumed in May, the people said. The financial institutions are working to finalize a new repayment schedule with the firm, they said. These loans “represent significant credits on the books” of the exposed organizations, the Lagos-headquartered Africa Finance Corp., which administers the financial agreement between Aiteo and the banks, said in written evidence to an English court last year. “A default under the loans would be a very serious matter.”  While energy giants like Shell and Chevron Corp. produce most of Nigeria’s oil, international companies have been offloading onshore assets to local players for more than a decade — a trajectory that is set to accelerate in the coming years. Aiteo’s multibillion-dollar purchase of a block from a consortium comprising Shell, TotalEnergies SE and Eni SpA remains the biggest of these divestments to date. Informed that it was in default in October 2019, Aiteo responded by obtaining an injunction from a Nigerian federal court that prevented its creditors from collecting on the debt demanded, which then stood at $288 million. The firm argued that the financiers were obliged to restructure its repayment schedule because of unforeseen “events of force majeure,” including oil theft and pipeline leaks. Having restarted production, Aiteo plans to barge crude to an export terminal rather than use its pipeline, which has experienced significant disruptions and losses, according to one of the people. The lenders initiated arbitration proceedings against Aiteo in London in December 2020, which are ongoing. Peters’ company has also sued Shell in two other cases before Nigerian courts, blaming the UK-headquartered oil major for the firm’s “purported inability” to “fully repay its alleged indebtedness.” Aiteo has alleged in court filings that Shell misrepresented the condition of the pipeline it sold in the 2015 deal and falsely presented itself as the owner of six oil wells the buyer believed were included in the transaction. Shell says the two lawsuits are baseless. Read More: Nigeria’s Aiteo Sues Shell Over Wells as Legal Disputes Escalate']\n",

      "['The bond market’s re-energized bulls may want to dial down their excitement, because their fortunes hinge on whether an abstract, almost elusive number, is as low as they assume. At the heart of what’s been shaping fixed-income investors’ views this year is the so-called neutral rate, which neither stimulates nor restricts the economy. Treasury bulls began the year invigorated by the belief that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive tightening was set to push borrowing costs well above the neutral level, and that officials would soon have to reverse course. The bet was that the era of low long-term rates would return and short-dated bonds would rally even faster with central bankers set to pivot to easing before year-end. Fast-forward to today and the 10-year yield is about where it started January, even after a rally this week sparked by data signaling cooling inflation. The yield curve, meanwhile, isn’t far from its deepest inversion in decades and wagers on 2023 interest-rate cuts have all but vanished.  Firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and TwentyFour Asset Management are taking notice. They’re warning that the neutral rate has increased, and that more Fed officials will eventually acknowledge that trend, tripping up bond bulls and rewarding those who have spurned Treasuries. For Goldman Sachs, the inflation-adjusted — or so-called real — neutral level is as much as four times that implied by the Fed’s long-run projections. “People haven’t really paid attention to the long-run fed funds rate,” said Felipe Villarroel, a portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management. “We think it’s about to move. It means that the scope for a rally in the 10-year Treasury is more limited as that anchor is higher.” Data Wednesday showed the annual consumer-price inflation rate has slowed to a two-year low of 3%, fueling speculation that the Fed could wrap up its tightening campaign after one more hike this month. On Thursday, Treasuries extended the rally after a report showed US producer prices barely rose in June from a year earlier. Still, Villarroel’s argument is also gaining support amid a slew of hot economic reports, from new home sales to consumer confidence. The readings suggest that the Fed’s benchmark rate, already its highest since 2007, may not be restrictive enough relative to the neutral rate. If so, it means the central bank won’t be able to pivot to easing any time soon. That’s a blow to investors who started the year anticipating a bond-market comeback from last year’s drubbing and amassed, by one measure, the biggest net long position since 2010. Following a 12% slide last year, Treasuries have earned 1.5% in 2023. Former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Bill Dudley, previously the New York Fed chief — are among those who have said bond investors’ pain may not be over, because markets are still underestimating the neutral rate, which is also known as the r-star. Summers is a paid contributor to Bloomberg Television and Dudley is a senior adviser to Bloomberg Economics. The idea is that forces such as a swelling fiscal deficit, the risk of deglobalization and rising investment in clean energy mean the downward pressures on borrowing costs that persisted for decades may be reversing. It’s a dynamic that marks a departure from the stretch of sluggish growth that capped the neutral rate after the Great Financial Crisis. “We’ve had 40 years – with exceptions – but with a trend of falling interest rates,” Lara Rhame, chief US economist at FS Investment, said on Bloomberg Television on Tuesday. “Looking ahead, if we get this bounce in r-star, and I think we are seeing it,” it will be difficult for bonds to see price gains. So far, the view on the neutral rate represents the minority. While a small group of Fed officials have nudged up their estimates of the long-run rate, the median – encompassing the majority — remains at 2.5%. Current New York Fed President John Williams and his colleagues essentially backed that view in an update of their model in May.  For his part, Villarroel at TwentyFour Asset Management sees the Fed’s median gradually rising to 3%, likely over the course of about six quarters. Investors, by and large, don’t anticipate that move. A swaps-based measure of the market’s assessment of the inflation-adjusted r-star is about 0.8%, consistent with the 10-year average before 2020. It’s also not far off the median Fed estimate of 0.5% for the neutral rate after inflation. For Jeffrey Rosenberg at BlackRock Inc., it’s precisely the difficulty of measuring where the neutral rate is that makes it hard to take an aggressive position in the bond market. With all the questions around it, “it really tempers the ability for the Fed to cut rates aggressively,” said Rosenberg, a portfolio manager of the firm’s Systematic Multi-Strategy Fund. And that dampens bonds’ role as a hedge, he added.  The neutral rate is also at the center of another market debate — over the deeply inverted yield curve, a widely watched indicator of impending recession. The current low estimate of r-star, the thinking goes, is capping long-term yields, potentially keeping the curve flatter than it otherwise would be.  The result is that the inversion overstates the prospect of an economic downturn, says Praveen Korapaty, chief interest-rate strategist at Goldman Sachs. His estimate for the real neutral rate — in a range of 1.5% to 2% — means that the curve should be about 50 basis points steeper. “It boggles my mind that we are looking at a very different set of facts, this cycle versus the last cycle, but somehow, magically, there’s this insistence that the level of rates the economy can withstand is exactly the same in both cycles,” he said.']\n",

      "['A deluge of fresh bank bonds is poised to sweep corporate debt markets, with some on Wall Street anticipating an uptick in sales as regulators weigh tougher regulatory standards.  The six biggest banks in the US are expected to sell between $28 billion and $32 billion of new bonds after they report quarterly earnings, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Regional banks, meanwhile, may eventually have to issue some $168 billion of holding-company debt to meet higher capital requirements, Bloomberg IntelligenceBloomberg Terminal said.  JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. could be among the first to test investor appetite with fresh debt after they post results Friday. “Banks spreads are near their recent tights, yields are attractive for investors, and there’s been a scarcity of recent issuance,” said Jon Curran, a money manager at Principal Asset Management. “Those criteria could present ripe conditions conducive for bank issuance.” A wave of bank bond sales in the second half would help make up for sluggishness earlier in the year amid a series of regional lender collapses and concern about an economic downturn.  Financial institutions, which are typically some of the biggest sellers of corporate bonds in the US, issued just $289 billion of the securities so far in 2023 — representing roughly 40% of investment-grade volume, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to $394 billion sold in the same period a year earlier.  Now, though, investors are growing more confident that the Federal Reserve will soon be able to end its most-aggressive monetary tightening cycle in a generation as inflation ebbs. At 3% last month, US consumer-price inflation is just one-third of the level it reached a year ago, which was the highest in four decades.  Volatility triggered by regional bank turmoil, as well as UBS Group AG’s takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG, has also largely dissipated. Barclays Plc analysts including Peter Troisi said that and easing conditions should help the biggest US banks to tap markets and resume long-term issuance trends. As long as major lenders “report good earnings, spreads come back in and debt capital markets desks have a good sense that there’s a lot of dry powder out there, they could easily up-size their targets,” CreditSights Inc. strategist Jesse Rosenthal said. Potential bond sales from regional lenders are also in focus as the banking industry’s earnings season kicks off and regulators consider harsher regulations.  The Fed’s top banking regulator on Monday proposed tougher capital rules, requiring banks to hold an extra two percentage points of capital – or $2 more of capital for every $100 in risk-weighted assets. The proposals would apply to financial companies with more than $100 billion in assets. The questions for regional firms are whether and when those potential requirements go into effect. Should banks need greater total loss-absorbing capacity, some lenders will eventually need to start tapping debt markets, said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Arnold Kakuda and Nicholas Beckwith. Midsize lenders such as Citizens Financial Group, M&T Bank Corp and KeyCorp could each face a potential $12 billion to $14 billion shortfall in their so-called TLAC requirements that forces them to tap markets, the analysts wrote. Larger regional banks including US Bancorp, PNC Financial Services Group and Truist Financial Corp have become more frequent issuers to meet potential shortfalls, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.   Representatives for M&T and Truist didn’t respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for Citizens, US Bancorp, PNC and KeyCorp declined to comment.  “US regional banks may be more-active bond issuers to meet the Federal Reserve’s new debt requirements,” the Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote. “Increased debt issuance may be a negative technical for regional banks whose bond spreads have already been pushed wider by this year’s banking turmoil.”']\n",

      "['A political showdown in Israel that swept up the shekel this year is having less sting as carry traders abandon it as a funding currency. With Israel again consumed by protests over the government’s controversial judicial overhaul, the shekel has proven surprisingly resilient, on track for its best week since early June with a gain of about 2.5% against the dollar. For BNY Mellon, it’s the outcome of a shift in the market by carry-trade investors who borrow in countries with lower interest rates to seek better returns. On Monday, the Bank of Israel paused a record stretch of monetary tightening but signaled a “real possibility” rates will need to go up further in the future after already rising to the highest since 2006. “We see the shekel as undervalued and it will likely recover as US rate expectations peak,” said Geoffrey Yu, a currency and macro strategist at BNY Mellon in London. “The carry trade is unwinding globally — and as the shekel is considered a savings-heavy funding currency, we see it as in a good position to strengthen.”  On the same day that Israel’s central bank delivered what Goldman Sachs Group Inc. called a “hawkish hold,” lawmakers moved forward with a key element of the controversial judicial overhaul that’s divided the country and unnerved investors. The standoff with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, the most religious and nationalist in the country’s history, has spilled over into the foreign-exchange market. Since the cabinet began to proceed with its plans in late January, the shekel is among the worst performers in the basket of expanded major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Until this year, the shekel was more correlated with global technology stocks than domestic triggers. That relationship broke down as protests against the overhaul mount. The political uncertainty contributed to a depreciation that fed into consumer prices to keep inflation above the government’s 1% to 3% target range.  While forced into more monetary tightening than it first envisaged, the Bank of Israel’s cumulative rate hikes fell slightly short of what the US central bank delivered during its campaign. The divergence allowed investors to borrow at lower rates in Israel and convert the proceeds into a currency they can lend out for a higher return. The turbulence in Israel will likely leave policymakers on alert, with one-year currency swaps indicating investors see the base rate at 4.845% in a year from the current 4.75%. In the US, inflation slid to a more than two-year low in June, ahead of what’s expected to be another rate hike later this month. But there’s now a better-than-even chance that a July 26 increase, which would take the benchmark US rate to 5.5%, could be the last in quite a while.  The debate in Israel over the judicial overhaul is far from over, leaving the shekel vulnerable to further bouts of weakness, according to Goldman. While strategists at Deutsche Bank AG expect Israeli bonds to extend their recent rebound on signs that inflation may have peaked, they are cautious on the currency, according to a report last week. Geneva-based GAMA Asset Management, which invests in global debt and also oversees a macro fund, is waiting for an easing of political tensions and compromise before making any bets on the shekel’s advance.  “Most of the pain is behind us, but the headline risks are still there for some time,” said Manuel Streiff, a founding partner of the firm.  Still, the backdrop remains favorable for the shekel. Israel, a major destination for technology investment, has long run a current-account surplus and become an exporter of natural gas. GAMA Asset Management bought the nation’s local-currency bonds six weeks ago when the 10-year yield was approaching 4%, a level it considered as “very attractive for a top quality sovereign issuer,” Streiff said.  “We hold a positive general view on the shekel, mainly on the back of structural positive tailwinds,” Streiff said.']\n",

Meratus is working with a financial adviser on the sale plans, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. The closely-held business is seeking a valuation of about $2 billion, the people said. Investment funds and other companies in the industry have shown preliminary interest in the business, the people said. Deliberations are at an early stage and no final decision has been made, they added. A representative for Meratus Group didn’t respond to requests for comment. Tracing its history to 1957, Meratus counts more than 60 strong vessels and over 500 trucks operating in over 45 routes, according to its website. Based in Surabaya, Indonesia, the company expanded service to Papua New Guinea in February and launched its direct China Indonesia Express route last year. Transportation companies in Asia have been active dealmakers in recent months. Nippon Express Holdings Inc. saidBloomberg Terminal in May that it would acquire Austrian logistics provider Cargo-Partner GmbH for €845 million ($948 million). Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd. agreed late last year to sellBloomberg Terminal its International Transportation Inc. unit to two separateBloomberg Terminal buyers in a deal worth about $1.2 billion in total. One of China’s biggest state-run investors is adding to the chorus of warnings over debt risks at the nation’s cash-strapped developers and local government financing vehicles. The National Council for Social Security Fund, which oversees about $417 billion according to the latest available figures, has advised asset managers that handle its money to sell some bonds including those from riskier LGFVs and private developers after a review, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Several of them mentioned that bonds from LGFVs in Tianjin, a debt-saddled northern port city, were singled out. The recent Sino-Ocean Group Holding Ltd.’s debt rout Bloomberg Terminalraised the pension fund’s concerns as one of its biggest asset managers holds a large position in the state-backed developer’s debt, the people said. That triggered the request for a health check of their exposure to riskier LGFVs and builders, if relevant bond prices are below 95% of face value, the people added. The move underscores the difficult balancing act facing Chinese authorities as they try to defuse risks in the credit markets without destabilizing the financial system. While offloading weaker bonds may help the state pension protect the value of its investments, it risks heightening market concerns about the health of LGFVs and developers at a time when Beijing is trying to restore confidence in the world’s second-largest economy. Read more: Investors Slash Chinese LGFV Bond Tenors to Shortest On Record A representative of the state pension fund declined to comment. The institution had over 3 trillion yuan under management as of the end of 2021, according to its latest financial report. “The most important variables impacting China’s economic growth over the next two years will be the success or failure of local government debt restructuring, and Beijing’s approach to the role of local government investment within China’s economy in the future,” Rhodium Group researchers wrote in a recent report. “A collapse in local government investment would be comparable to economic impact of the crisis in the property market.” China’s anemic economic recovery and housing crisis have rekindled concerns about ballooning local government debt, including some $9 trillion of debt held by LGFVs, which are off-balance-sheet firms tasked to build infrastructure projects.  The city of Tianjin faced the biggest threat as of last year, with debt almost three times as large as its income, according to Bloomberg calculations based on available official data.  In another sign of investor wariness of the sector’s repayment risks, the average tenor of newly issued onshore LGFV bonds fell to 2.51 years in the first half of this year, the shortest since at least 1999 when Bloomberg’s data series began.  Meantime, the average coupon on LGFV yuan notes jumped to 4.39% from 3.94% last year, with that on Tianjin’s up nearly a percentage point. Showing a sense of urgency, Chinese authorities are weighing plans to support cash-strapped cities and counties by allowing additional local bond issuance to help pay down hidden debt in higher-risk areas, Bloomberg reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter. Indicating widening stress among Chinese developers, Sino-Ocean’s bonds plummetedBloomberg Terminal last week after Bloomberg News reported that a shareholder-led working group engaged a financial advisor to conduct due diligenceBloomberg Terminal and that it’s workingBloomberg Terminal with major shareholders on a plan to resolve debt risks. More broadly, a Bloomberg index of Chinese junk dollar bonds, dominated by private developers, has fallen in five out of the first seven months this year, registering a 10% loss for 2023 so far.']\n",

      "['India’s top companies will have to step up ESG reporting and show credibility of such disclosures as a slew of regulations take effect. The biggest 1,000 firms by market value have to start publishing a Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report from the year ended March 2023. The Securities and Exchange Board of India will also require a ‘reasonable’ audit for a select set of indicators — known as core BRSR — for 150 of the largest on the list effective in the current financial year, according to a circular Wednesday.   The move makes Sebi the first among global regulators to impose tighter norms. Globally, most ESG information is subject to a limited assurance, which means assurance of no negative observations, while ‘reasonable’ assurance is more comprehensive and robust, said Sumit Seth, partner at Price Waterhouse & Co. The audit requirement will expand to all 1,000 companies over four years and, gradually, will also cover vendors and partners, Sebi said.  The additional compliance by companies will improve credibility of disclosures and mitigate greenwashing risks, Seth said. A PWC survey last year showed that 75% of investors would have more confidence in corporate sustainability reporting with reasonable assurance, which is the same level as a financial audit. World over, the focus on environment, social and governance practices has run into political and activist backlash accusing businesses and investors of too much talk and too little action. That’s put the onus on financial regulators to speed up frameworks for standardized reporting and scrutiny of ESG parameters. The ESG regulatory ecosystem in India is getting built quickly. India’s accounting institute earlier this year issued a globally-adapted sustainability assurance standard to guide auditors. For now, Sebi has given companies discretion to pick any ESG audit service provider as long as it poses no conflict of interest.  Several international assurance providers have India offices, said Prabodha Acharya, chief sustainability officer at Mumbai-based JSW Group. He added that many large Indian companies including his already follow global ESG reporting standards and limited third party assurance. The challenge now lies in standardizing ESG ratings. No two rating companies work on the same criteria and there is a trend now that even ESG rating providers are being rated, Acharya said.  Sebi recently prescribed who can provide ratings in India, but harmonization remains a hurdle across international financial markets.

      "['Angola’s inflation rate climbed to a four-month high in June after a government decision to stop defending the kwanza and cut gasoline subsidies. The annual inflation rate in Africa’s third-biggest oil producer rose to 11.25% in June from 10.6% in the previous month, data published on the National Statistics Institute’s website showed. That’s the second consecutive increase after 15 months of declines.   Contributing to the increase were higher costs of food and transport, according to the statistics institute. Angola’s treasury abstained from dollar sales in April and May, according to Fitch Ratings, accelerating the depreciation of the kwanza to 39% since then. In June, the government also scrapped subsidies for gasoline, which almost doubled pump prices in a nation that had one of the world’s cheapest fuel prices.  The central bank, whose governor was replaced in June, is planning to revise its inflation target of between 9% and 11% for the end of 2023. The acceleration in inflation and expectations that it will remain elevated may persuade its monetary policy committee to increase interest rates on July 14. The MPC heldBloomberg Terminal the key rate at 17% in May after two successive cutsBloomberg Terminal.  Fitch Ratings said in a report on June 23 it expects a weaker kwanza to be one of the main drivers of upward pressure on inflation given the country’s reliance on imported food. It forecasts inflation to average 14.7% in 2023 and increase to 17.1% in 2024. Food goods account for 55% of the weight of the consumer price index basket in Angola and for 18% of the country’s total import of goods, according to Fitch.      Global oil demand won’t grow as fast as previously expected this year due to the faltering economies of developed nations, the International Energy Agency said. World fuel consumption will increase by 2.2 million barrels a day — or about 2% — in 2023, a reduction of about 220,000 barrels from last month’s forecast, the Paris-based agency said in a report on Thursday. Demand nonetheless remains on track to hit record levels later this year, draining inventories substantially in the second half. “World oil demand is coming under pressure from the challenging economic environment, not least because of the dramatic tightening of monetary policy,” the IEA said. “Demand in the OECD, and Europe in particular, is languishing amid a grinding slowdown in industrial activity.” Crude futures climbed above $80 a barrel in London on Wednesday for the first time in two months, partly on signs that cooling inflation may help end the cycle of rising interest rates. World oil markets are tightening as Saudi Arabia and its OPEC+ partners curb supplies while fuel use continues to recover from the pandemic. Markets have been fractionally oversupplied this quarter, with inventories at their highest level in almost two years. Supply restraint by the Saudis has been offset by other producers, such as Iran and the US, the IEA said. Given the weaker demand outlook, markets won’t tighten as sharply in the months ahead as previously thought, according to the agency. Yet the rest of 2023 will still be marked by supply deficits, as global demand increases to an all-time high of 102.1 million barrels a day on average this year. About 70% of the growth in consumption will come from ChinaBloomberg Terminal as it expands petrochemical use.  Production in the OPEC+ alliance is poised to slump by 1 million barrels a day this month as Saudi Arabia implements a new cutback that depletes its output to a two-year low. Last week the kingdom pledged to prolong that reduction into August, and its ally Russia also promised to pare exports. For 2024, the IEA boosted world consumption growth estimates by 290,000 barrels a day as a stronger outlook for China stands to bolster gasoil use. Still, at 1.1 million barrels a day the global growth rate for next year is barely half of this year’s level amid improved efficiency and the growing popularity of electric vehicles. ']\n",

High temperatures are expected in major growing areas of the northwestern region from mid-July, a key period for flowering and boll development, with the mercury climbing above 40C (104F) in some districts, according to the National Meteorological Center. The heat could cause flowers and bolls to fall, leading to a smaller crop, COFCO Futures said in a report Wednesday.  China is the world’s biggest textile producer and one of the largest cotton importers. Any more reductions in its crop could increase concerns over domestic supplies and push China to buy more from the international market. A state-owned agency in June already predicted a 13.5% dropBloomberg Terminal in production, and Beijing is planning to release cotton from its state reserves to boost supplies.  Extreme weather has hurt agricultural production across China this year, from soybeans to rice, posing increased risksBloomberg Terminal for the country’s food security. This has become an increasingly important priority for President Xi Jinping after Covid and the Russian war in Ukraine disrupted global supply chains.  Under a government push to increase grain production, more farmers in Xinjiang were also encouraged to grow wheat rather than cotton this year.  The condition of the cotton in Xinjiang, where the vast majority of the country’s crop is grown, is already weaker after a freeze and rains in April and May delayed development. That makes plants even more vulnerable to extreme weather, according to a note from Orient Futures.  The most suitable temperature for flowering and boll development is about 25-30C, so a continuous period of much hotter weather in July would cut yields and reduce the length of the fiber, Galaxy Futures said in a note.  Meanwhile, demand from textile producers is weak as operations are restricted by curbs on power use and low overseas orders. Consumption may pick up going forward, however, as the market enters the traditional season for peak demand in September and October, while commercial inventories of cotton and cotton yarn are not high, analysts said.

And that’s going to show somewhere, it will show in the earnings,” Karim Chedid, head of EMEA iShares investment strategy, said in a phone interview. “It’s a cheap market, but we’re not running, we’re not overweight despite the cheap valuations.”  UK equities are the worst performers among major European and developed markets this year as the country increasingly looks like an outlier in the global fight to quash high inflation, spurring continued hawkishness from the Bank of England and fueling fears of recession. The FTSE 100 Index is trading at a discount of about 50% to both the S&P 500 and the MSCI All-Country World Index, the widest since at least 2005, when Bloomberg began compiling the data. “There’s still some room for further pain in UK earnings, especially in the consumer sectors,” said Chedid. “The growth-inflation trade-off in the UK is starker than anywhere else in terms of the trade-off that’s facing the BOE.” Data today showed that the UK economy shrank lessBloomberg Terminal than expected in May, further adding to concerns that the central bank has more hiking to do. Sentiment around the UK economy is so poor that the nation’s stocks and credit are now the cheapest globally, Morgan Stanley strategists said earlier this week. BlackRock Investment Institute strategists are underweight UK equities on a six to 12-month tactical view, but are neutral on UK gilts. UK government bonds have fully priced in the higher-for-longer rates path, according to Chedid. In the UK equity space, BlackRock prefers the internationally-exposed FTSE 100 to the FTSE 250 because they’re more concerned about the domestic demand situation, said Chedid.']\n",

The British bank may seek about 500 million euros ($557 million) for the unit, formerly known as Barclaycard Germany, the people said, asking not to be named as the discussions aren’t public. The division, based in Hamburg, houses 700 employees and could attract interest from other banks and private equity funds that own a bank, they said. Deliberations are ongoing and it’s possible that Barclays may not proceed with a deal, the people said. A representative for the lender declined to comment.  The potential disposal is adding to signs that Barclays Chief Executive Officer C.S. Venkatakrishnan is stepping up efforts to review the bank’s footprint across business lines and geographies, which could lead to further exits. For instance, Barclays has recently initiated the sale of a portfolio of Italian loans, and is separately working with Boston Consulting Group to evaluate its strategy.  The German division has 2 million clients and had a loan book, or assets, of £4.3 billion ($5.6 billion) at the end of last year, according to filings.

Godrej Properties Ltd. will develop luxury residential projects on two plots of land in Gurugram, a satellite town near New Delhi, the company said in an exchange filing. It is projecting sales of 31 billion rupees ($377 million) from the projects spread over a combined area of more than 3 hectares.  A growing population of wealthy Indians is boosting real estate investments in India, particularity for premium housing, prompting builders to come up with more such projects. Earlier this year, another developer DLF sold 1,137 apartments costing almost a million dollars each in just three days.

Luxury apartment sales in one of the fastest-growing major economies increased by 151% from a year ago as home buyers look for larger space with better amenities post the pandemic.  The number of super rich households, those earning more than 20 million rupees a year, almost doubled to 1.8 million in five years to 2021, showed a report by People’s Research on India’s Consumer Economy and India’s Citizen Environment last week.  An unprecedented amount raisedBloomberg Terminal from the bond market by the nation’s property companies shows that a pause in interest-rate hike by the central bank and the resilience of the economy has bolstered the home demand. India Ratings and Research Pvt. forecasts home sales to increase 9% in the current fiscal year that ends March.  India will make a second attempt to send an uncrewed mission to the lunar surface Friday, joining the US, China and others in a new moon race.  The Chandrayaan-3 is scheduled to blast off at 2:35 p.m. local time Friday from India’s main spaceport on Sriharikota, an island off the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. It will spend about six weeks in space before attempting to touch down close to the lunar south pole, near where the nation’s previous moon mission ended in a crash in 2019.  If successful, the rover will conduct experiments on the chemical makeup of the moon’s surface and search for water. The rover will have a life span of one lunar day, which is equivalent to 14 days on Earth.  Only the Soviet Union, China and the US have made successful moon landings, and only NASA has sent astronauts there.  The US aims to send humans back to the moon before the end of the decade, using landers developed by Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX, and China has plans for its first crewed lunar mission by 2030. Russia, which hasn’t landed on the moon since the end of the Soviet Union, will attempt to send a robotic mission next month. Japan has an uncrewed mission planned for August, too. India’s new mission comes as the country has made a breakthrough in boosting cooperation with the US in outer space. The country is also in discussions with Japan to work on a moon mission together, ISRO Chairman S Somanath told reporters in New Delhi on Monday. During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to Washington last month, India signed the Artemis Accords, a US-backed framework with more than two-dozen other nations — but not China or Russia — governing joint missions and civilian space exploration. NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to a joint mission next year that will include sending an Indian astronaut to the International Space Station. India’s space infrastructure includes 25 Earth observation satellites and about 30 other satellites, Somanath wrote in an article in the May issue of Yojana. That puts India well behind China, which had 590 operating satellites at the end of 2022, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. While Chinese rockets have carried more than two dozen people into space since China’s first astronaut, Yang Liwei, went to orbit in 2003, it’s been nearly 40 years since the only Indian to go into outer space, Rakesh Sharma, traveled aboard a Soviet rocket to the USSR’s space station. ISRO has not yet set a date for the initial flight of its human spaceflight program, called Gaganyaan, but in his article Somanath described the project as “at an advanced stage.” By signing the Artemis Accords and getting NASA to agree to send an Indian astronaut to the ISS, Modi may reap political benefits as he prepares to ask voters next year to extend his premiership into a second decade, said Konark Bhandari, an associate fellow at Carnegie India, a New Delhi-based affiliate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “It would be impressive to have an astronaut of your own in space before the elections,” he said.']\n",

BPEA-EQT plans to commit nearly 30% of the $11.2 billion Baring Private Equity Asia Fund VIII, according to Jimmy Mahtani, a partner at the firm who is responsible for investments in India. Three of the five early deals from that fund were made in India, he added. EQT acquired Baring Private Equity Asia Ltd. last year to add scale in the region.  “The long-term, structural growth of the Indian economy backed by the government’s investments in physical and digital infrastructure have made India’s investment opportunity real,” Mahtani said.  The planned investment would be the biggest yet by one of the firm’s funds in India. It deployed $2 billion and $270 million respectively into the world’s most populous country with two earlier funds that had raised smaller amounts.  BPEA-EQT’s increasing fund sizes have enabled it to make larger investments. The firm can commit up to $2 billion of equity to a deal, and more through co-investments with its investors, Mahtani said. Last month, the buyout firm led a consortium in one of the largest private equity financial services deals in India. The group agreed to buy a majority stakeBloomberg Terminal in HDFC Credila Financial Services Ltd, the student loans business of mortgage financier Housing Development Finance Corp., which mergedBloomberg Terminal with HDFC Bank Ltd. this month. Read More: BPEA EQT-Led Group Buys Stake in $1.3 Billion Credila Bloomberg Terminal With deal sizes in India on the rise, there will likely be an uptick in club deals like Credila in the next three years, spurring a need for some investors and general partners to join together, Mahtani said. BPEA-EQT will continue to be the majority shareholder in nearly all the investments, barring a few minority ones,  he added.  Meanwhile, in infrastructure, EQT will look to build up smaller platforms with deals in energy, digital data centers, transportation and logistics, and education and healthcare, according to Piyush Singhvi, a managing director. So far, the firm has committed $750 million through its global infrastructure funds across renewable energy and digital infrastructure in the country.  The firm leaned on its historical ties with Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte to enter a partnership to establishBloomberg Terminal O2 Power, a renewable platform in India, in 2020. Marcus Wallenberg, part of the Wallenberg family who are the largest shareholders in EQT, served as a board member at the Singapore state investor for 12 years through 2020.  Such infrastructure is becoming “core” in India, reflecting lower but steady returns as the market grows and matures, Singhvi said. ']\n",

      "['  Listen to Odd Lots on Apple PodcastsListen to Odd Lots on SpotifySubscribe to the newsletter Due to a combination of drought, climate change and booming growth, Arizona is facing looming water scarcity. But for all the sprawl and population increase, the overwhelming amount of water used in the state is not consumed by residences, but rather farmers. So naturally, many argue that we should be doing less agriculture in the desert and move the production of cotton, alfalfa and various vegetables towards places with more rain. On this episode, we speak with Trevor Bales, the proprietor of Bales Hay Farm & Ranch in Arizona about his family’s history in the state and why he thinks this dry desert is a great place to grow alfalfa. On June 16, the same day Secretary of State Antony Blinken was set to fly to Beijing for meetings with senior Chinese officials, the State Department he oversees reported anomalous activity to Microsoft that the tech firm later blamed on China-based hackers. It was Blinken’s second try at making the high-profile trip. His first attempt in February was derailed at the last minute by the discovery of an alleged Chinese spy balloon floating above the US — which President Joe Biden ordered shot down by the US Air Force. This time, the Biden administration is staying the course on its China-engagement strategy, continuing the string of contact with Beijing that began with Blinken. But the hacking episode underlines the growing risks of restarting crucial diplomatic engagement between the world’s two largest economies when geopolitical competition between Washington and Beijing remains as fierce as ever.   Blinken’s trip last month — the most senior US delegation to China in five years — was only the first of several visits aimed at trying to reestablish more durable diplomatic links that China mostly severed in the wake of then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s controversial stop in Taiwan. China responded to Pelosi’s trip by holding unprecedented military drills around Taiwan. Similar exercises were held in April, when Taiwan’s leader, Tsai Ing-wen, met House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the US.   “At the end of the day, they get to decide whether they’re gonna do these meetings or not, and they seem to be feeling they want to put some skin in the game to see where this can lead,” said Christopher Johnson, the president of China Strategies Group, a political risk consultancy, and a former senior China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency.  “If something really significant were to happen, like a mash-up in the South China Sea or something bad, then obviously that would be it. But I think garden-variety cyber and stuff like that, I don’t think that’s enough,” he added. China has shown a similar commitment. Beijing shrugged off Biden’s reference to Xi as a “dictator” days after Blinken’s visit, still welcoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in China weeks later. US climate envoy John Kerry is set to arrive in Beijing on Sunday.  Blinken raised the issue of hacking on Thursday in a meeting with China’s top foreign policy official Wang Yi on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations foreign ministers meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, a senior State Department official told reporters.  The agency wouldn’t say if Blinken had raised the latest incident, which included the alleged breach of the email account of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Before the revelations, she’d been both one of those seeking to visit China as part of the engagement efforts and a leading figure in the administration’s moves to limit Beijing’s access to high-tech semiconductors and chip-making equipment. The hack that was revealed this week was a “sophisticated” example of China’s increasingly advanced cyber abilities, according to George Barnes, the deputy director of the US National Security Agency. It was “yet another example of what is happening around us every day,” he told a conference of intelligence professionals in Maryland on Thursday. “China is steadfast and determined to penetrate our government, our companies, our critical infrastructure.”  China routinely accuses the US of hacking. The Foreign Ministry in Beijing this week called the US “the world’s biggest hacking empire and global cyber thief,” and asked for Washington to explain its own activities. Amid the continuing current of irritants in the relationship with China, Republican lawmakers have stepped up criticism of Biden’s diplomatic strategy. Mike Gallagher, who chairs a House select committee on competition with China, derides it as “zombie engagement.”   On Thursday, Gallagher’s committee announced a hearing next week on the Biden administration’s China strategy that will see will see three senior policy appointees appear as witnesses: Ely Ratner, the assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs; Daniel Kritenbrink, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs; and Thea Rozman Kendler, the assistant secretary of commerce for export administration. Earlier this week, Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, issued a subpoena to Blinken for documents related to the administration’s moves against China. Using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China, he accused the State Department of “continued weakness and passivity in the face of PRC aggression.”  The administration rejects that criticism, highlighting the numerous sanctions and other export controls that it’s imposed.  “One of the things we heard over and over from Chinese officials is their deep protests and their deep complaints about the competitive actions that we have taken,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday.']\n",

World fuel consumption will increase by 2.2 million barrels a day — or about 2% — in 2023, a reduction of about 220,000 barrels from last month’s forecast, the Paris-based agency said in a report on Thursday. Demand nonetheless remains on track to hit record levels later this year, draining inventories substantially in the second half. “World oil demand is coming under pressure from the challenging economic environment, not least because of the dramatic tightening of monetary policy,” the IEA said. “Demand in the OECD, and Europe in particular, is languishing amid a grinding slowdown in industrial activity.” Crude futures climbed above $80 a barrel in London on Wednesday for the first time in two months, partly on signs that cooling inflation may help end the cycle of rising interest rates. World oil markets are tightening as Saudi Arabia and its OPEC+ partners curb supplies while fuel use continues to recover from the pandemic. Markets have been fractionally oversupplied this quarter, with inventories at their highest level in almost two years. Supply restraint by the Saudis has been offset by other producers, such as Iran and the US, the IEA said. Given the weaker demand outlook, markets won’t tighten as sharply in the months ahead as previously thought, according to the agency. Yet the rest of 2023 will still be marked by supply deficits, as global demand increases to an all-time high of 102.1 million barrels a day on average this year. About 70% of the growth in consumption will come from ChinaBloomberg Terminal as it expands petrochemical use.  Production in the OPEC+ alliance is poised to slump by 1 million barrels a day this month as Saudi Arabia implements a new cutback that depletes its output to a two-year low. Last week the kingdom pledged to prolong that reduction into August, and its ally Russia also promised to pare exports. For 2024, the IEA boosted world consumption growth estimates by 290,000 barrels a day as a stronger outlook for China stands to bolster gasoil use. Still, at 1.1 million barrels a day the global growth rate for next year is barely half of this year’s level amid improved efficiency and the growing popularity of electric vehicles. ']\n",

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, one of two regulators of the nation’s so-called superannuation system, had previously put funds on notice over their valuations of private assets. However, a review by the Financial Regulator Assessment Authority released Thursday found it needs to be doing more. “APRA should direct greater attention to proactively identifying and comprehensively understanding risks,” the review said. Along with valuation practices, the FRAA said the conversion of unlisted or illiquid assets to cash was a key concern, along with “increasingly complex investment strategies.”  The funds are facing increased regulatory scrutiny after ramping up their holdings of unlisted assets both locally and abroad in recent years. In the past week, some of the biggest players told Bloomberg they’ve seen writedowns in their property portfolios, but brushed off concerns that the losses were materially impacting members’ returns.  Australian Pension Funds With $500 Billion Go Bargain Hunting The FRAA said a range of stakeholders participated in the review, noting that some “observed that an increased examination of unlisted assets and associated valuation practices was also required. Participants perceived APRA’s work in this area may have been delayed and deprioritised.” The review made a total of five recommendations, including improving data and technology capabilities. “The recommendations provide helpful guidance and reinforcement for a more effective APRA into the future,” APRA Chair John Lonsdale said in a statement.

The Tokyo-based firm has made a comeback in corporate equity derivatives in addition to Delta One products that help investors track underlying assets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Simon Yates, Nomura’s global head of equities, said in an interview. The company has also started debt financing business in those regions. Since January, the firm has hired more than 30 executive directors or managing directors for equities globally from the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit Suisse. About half of those have yet to join the firm. The goal is to get private equity firms, hedge funds and large companies as clients, Yates said. “What we’re looking to establish is a much, much lighter cost-based business, not full service, and we think we can do that with a small headcount,” he said of the bank’s plans for Europe. “This is a very selective re-entry into businesses really copying our US model.”  The renewed focus on trading by Japan’s biggest brokerage comes at a time when the firm is seeking to revive earnings growth after three years of profit declines. The firm took a roughly $2.9 billion hit from its dealings with family office Archegos Capital Management LP, which collapsed in 2021. The company is now separately looking to expandBloomberg Terminal its European trading desk focused on emerging-market corporate debt, a business the brokerage cut repeatedly in recent years.

Stela Modrakovic, Stephanie Peritore and Aous Labbane have also joined. For Delta One in the region, the firm is targeting swap balances of $3 billion by year-end. The company said in 2016 it would close a range of European equity businesses, from research to derivatives and financing, as part of an overhaul designed to turn around foreign operations. In the US, new joiners include Joshua Lukeman and Susan Enright from Credit Suisse, Ganapathy Pattabiraman from Deutsche Bank AG and Jason Jerutis from Bank of America Corp. “We’re trying to be quite surgical in getting people who can do this much more structured business,” Yates said. The world’s biggest banks shared about $14 billion in revenue from equities trading in the first quarter of 2023, an 18% drop from the same period a year earlier, according to data from Coalition Greenwich. The industry is dominated by JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. In Asia excluding Japan, Nomura will offer a full equities trading business including cash and synthetic prime brokerage and structured notes. New hires include Arnaud Lannic and Florence Lam, previously at Bank of America, Clement Florentin from Credit Suisse, and Hally Seo and Harvey Zhang from JPMorgan. Yates said the collapse of Credit Suisse had made a lot of talented recruits available, and meant that clients were seeking to replace the Swiss bank as a counterpart.  “The one thing that would really help our European effort would be a better market environment, a lot of interest in European stocks,” he said. “But I think we have to get past the concerns of very high inflation in the UK and the possibility of a quite hard recession.” Revenue at Nomura’s global markets division rose 18% last fiscal year to 656.3 billion yen ($4.7 billion).

      "['Food inflation is hurting demand for chocolate, with European cocoa-processing giant Barry Callebaut AG reporting lower sales as higher prices force consumers to cut back on indulgent treats. The company’s sales volumes fell 2.7% in the first nine months of the year, with its gourmet and specialists business seeing the biggest drop, it saidBloomberg Terminal on Thursday. Its shares retreated as much as 2%, while cocoa futures slumped to the lowest in more than two weeks in London.  The results show the chocolate market is starting to languish after rebounding from the pandemic. Spending on discretionary items like chocolate has fallen as consumers face a cost-of-living crisis and rising borrowing costs.  “We witnessed soft volume in a continued inflationary environment which affected customer demand,” Callebaut Chief Executive Officer Peter Feld said in a statement. “Our volume was in line with the declining underlying chocolate confectionery market.” Barry Callebaut had already said sales suffered in the first six months of its fiscal year, amid inflation pressures and as the closure of its Wieze plant affected production of some of its products. Still, it expects flat volume growth for the full year.  That means the company needs its volumes to recover by 8% in the fourth quarter — a challenge as higher chocolate prices hurt demand — according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Diana Gomes.  Cocoa has surged about 17% in London this year, reaching a 13-year high earlier this month amid concerns about crops in West Africa. The gain has driven up the price of chocolate bars and squeezed manufacturers’ margins. Data on Thursday also showed cocoa processingBloomberg Terminal in Europe, the top consuming region, fell 5.7% in the second quarter from a year earlier. Grindings — the process by which beans are turned into candy ingredients — fell to 343,283 tons, the lowest for any quarter since the pandemic hit in 2020, according to the European Cocoa Association. Processing data for both North America and Asia will be published next week.  Still, there are signs that demand is holding up, with Americans willing to spend on chocolate even as higher costs mean they’re getting less for the money, according to data from researcher Euromonitor International Ltd.']\n",

      "['CityPoint, a 36-story office building in London’s financial district, became one of the symbols of the financial crisis when a Beacon Capital Partners Inc. fund missed a payment on loans secured by the property just over a decade ago. As the turmoil receded, Brookfield Asset Management Inc. eventually took over the tower. Now, the rise of work from home and surging interest rates mean Bank of America analysts are warning that a default on loans linked to the property is likely.  The building isn’t alone in facing a wobble having become tangled up in problems after the 2008 crisis. An office complex in Frankfurt and towers in New York are also running into difficulties again. The various troubles highlight how low borrowing costs led many investors to become comfortable holding properties with a tarnished history, betting it would be different this time. But now, many large occupiers are focused on the best quality buildings and the relics of the last crash are struggling to hold their value. Morgan Stanley analysts forecast that US commercial real estate prices will fall by more than they did in the financial crisis. “The low cost of debt due to quantitative easing has led to the same property value expansion as observed during the previous cycle,” said Nicole Lux, a senior fellow at Bayes Business School whose research areas include real estate finance. “Lenders and investors now have to admit that they are facing the same refinancing issues for their properties.” Brookfield is initiating discussions for an extension of the debt and is confident it will be repaid in full when the building is eventually sold, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. It has a plan to boost leasing in the near term and has reduced the loan-to-value ratio since commercial mortgage-backed securities linked to the building were issued in 2018, they said. Read More: WFH to Wipe Out $800 Billion From Office Values, McKinsey Says The issues reflect a wider trend in credit, where some companies that have undergone restructurings in recent years are back in distressed territory. Spanish gambling operator Codere, for example, is trying to raise rescue financing as part of its fourth debt restructuring since 2015. In real estate, an industry that relies more than most on leverage to boost returns, the results are similar. Banks are now demanding more equity in return for refinancing loans to protect themselves from any further declines, and buyer interest has dried up as yields on safer investments increase.  That’s left a number of buildings previously sold out of distressed situations looking potentially shaky once again. Germany’s biggest office property, The Squaire, a curvy building that houses companies like KPMG and Michelin near Frankfurt airport, is a good example. It was developed by IVG, once Germany’s biggest property company by market value before it filed for insolvency in 2013. The Squaire was then bought by a consortium that included South Korea’s Hana Financial Group for almost €1 billion ($1.1 billion) in December 2019, just months before the pandemic upended the real estate market. Two years ago, the building was refinanced in a commercial mortgage backed securities deal arranged by Bank of America, which valued the property at €833 million. The total interest-only loan was €540 million and included a 10% increase in the senior debt, according to a report from Fitch. The issue is whether a sale now would cover the debt. Analysts at S&P estimate its recovery value at just over €570 million, leaving little room to ensure debt holders get repaid if the owners default. Many of the CMBS notes have been downgraded to reflect that possibility. Hana didn’t respond to a request for comment. At the time of the financing, there were warningsBloomberg Terminal that the issuance could underestimate the risk posed by post-Covid business travel for a building where proximity to the airport is a key selling point.  Shortly before the CMBS was issued, Deutsche Lufthansa SA moved hundreds of staff out of The Squaire as part of a cost-cutting plan, Bloomberg reported at the time. The vacancy rate rose to 16% at the end of last year, from around 2% in 2019. “To put more debt on, you know, during the pandemic, felt incongruous,” Euan Gatfield, a managing director at Fitch, said in an interview. “If you weren’t a business that was so geared to business travel you’d probably have a hard time convincing your staff it would be the place to locate.” Read More: Click here to subscribe to ‘The Brink’ newsletter There are similar stories in the US, where Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has warned that office real estate has been hurt by the rise of working from home and surrounding properties are also suffering in many major cities as a result. “It feels like some part of that will be persistent and will last,” he said last month. The potential damage was highlighted in a report Thursday from McKinsey Global Institute. Modeling the impact on valuations by 2030, it said remote work risks an $800 billion hit to the price of office buildings in major cities. The upheaval has seen US regulators ask lenders to work with credit-worthy borrowers facing stress in the commercial real estate market. Their guidance – which came in the wake of the collapse of a number of regional banks – recommends measures such as payment deferrals. There are “concerns about the economic conditions as well as more regulatory oversight,” said Jackie Bowie, head of EMEA at Chatham Financial. “The recent bank failures have caused many banks to tighten their lending standards especially in the CRE market.” In New York, two towers once owned by developer Harry Macklowe are back in the news for credit reasons. Macklowe lost control of those buildings, plus others, during the financial crisis. Now, the Chetrit Group has transferred 850 Third Avenue to its lenders while Pearlmark sold the Tower 56 building in the Plaza District at a loss from when it bought the building in 2008. “Downtown America is still struggling with getting back,” said Apollo Global Management Inc. chief economist Torsten Slok. The percentage of US CMBS loans in the office sector in special servicing rose to the highest since 2017 last month, according to data provider Trepp. More than half of the $2 billion in loans transferred to a special servicer, which typically happens when there’s a default, were offices. Back in London, some bonds issued by the owners of the Canary Wharf district are being quoted at distressed-level prices as it grapples with the new work-from-home model. Last month, it was dealt a blow when HSBC Holdings Plc decided to move to a smaller building in the City of London. The pain has echoes with the financial crisis. Qatar increased its stake in the east London financial district in 2009 after the landlord decided to sell shares to repay an £880 million-pound ($1.14 billion) loan after the value of its properties plunged. The country’s sovereign wealth fund subsequently took control of the area with Brookfield in 2015. Read More: HSBC Quitting Canary Wharf for the City Rocks Docklands District A short subway ride west, at CityPoint, the Bank of America analysts said in the note last month that a 12-month extension is likely for the loan — “either consensual or via default” — while the parties consider various exit options.  In a downside scenario where the vacancy rate rises, the tower might fall in value to as little as £450 million, they wrote. That would mark a drop of about a third from the current independent valuation. There’s about £460 million of outstanding debt linked to the building, the person with knowledge of the matter said, and the surrounding area has become more attractive to occupiers with the opening of the transport line linking Heathrow to Canary Wharf. “At least some of the lessons from previous crises have been forgotten,” said Tolu Alamutu, a credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, who was speaking generally. “The real estate sector may be facing a much more testing outlook than some issuers may be able to weather.”']\n",

      "['India, the world’s biggest rice shipper, is considering banning exports of most varieties, a move that may send already lofty global prices higher as the disruptive El Niño weather pattern returns.  The government is discussing a plan to ban exports of all non-Basmati rice, according to people familiar with the matter. That’s because of rising domestic prices and authorities want to avoid the risk of more inflation, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is not public. If implemented, a ban would affect about 80% of India’s rice exports. Such a move may lower domestic prices, but it risks sending global costs even higher. Rice is a staple for about half of the world’s population, with Asia consuming about 90% of global supply. Benchmark prices have already soared to a two-year high on fears that the return of El Niño will damage crops. India accounts for about 40% of the global rice trade and has sought to tighten exports of some varieties. Last year, the South Asian nation banned broken rice exports and imposed a 20% duty on shipments of white and brown rice after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent prices of food staples like wheat and corn soaring. The country has also restricted wheat and sugar exports. Representatives for the food, trade and finance ministries didn’t respond to emails or text messages seeking comment. India supplies rice to more than 100 countries, with Benin, China, Senegal, Cote d’Ivoire and Togo among its biggest customers. Shares of Indian rice millers fell on news of the potential ban. KRBL Ltd., the country’s biggest rice company, slumped as much as 3.7% before paring losses. Chaman Lal Setia Exports Ltd. declined as much as 1.4%, Kohinoor Foods Ltd. dropped 2.9% while LT Foods Ltd. tumbled 4.4%.  Importers such as Indonesia, China and the Philippines have been aggressively stockpiling rice this year. El Niño conditions have developed in the tropical Pacific for the first time in seven years, according to the World Meteorological Organization, threatening to bring drought to many rice-growing regions. A potential ban by India will add to worries over supply. India’s plan comes after its consumer price inflation quickened in June mainly due to higher food prices. Bloomberg Economics expectsBloomberg Terminal inflation to rebound further after the latest surge in tomato prices, a key ingredient in Indian cuisine, and an increase in the government’s support price for monsoon-sown crops. Barclays Bank Plc and Yes Bank have raised their inflation forecasts.

      "['Russia is finally cutting crude exports, at the most advantageous moment possible.   Moscow has pledged to curb shipments to global markets by 500,000 barrels a day next month. It’s a show of unity with fellow OPEC+ leader Saudi Arabia, but also an attempt to answer months of questions about whether Russia could really have been cutting oil production — as announced in February — while simultaneously raising crude exports.  August gives Moscow the perfect opportunity to make these important gestures at minimal cost. Companies can redirect crude away from export terminals to domestic refiners, which will be running at a higher rate thanks to the end of spring maintenance and a period of generous state subsidies.  In fact, Russia should be able to achieve its export target without needing additional production cuts. Bloomberg Terminal  “Seeking to strengthen its ties with Saudi Arabia, Russia is set to fulfill its export cut pledge,” said Viktor Katona, head crude analyst at market intelligence firm Kpler Ltd. “The 500,000-barrel-a-day export cut will be fully absorbed by the domestic refining segment.”    Russian officials have given repeated assurances that the country’s 500,000 barrel-a-day production cut was implemented in March. But there’s no official data to back this up — the figures were classified in April — and tanker-tracking data show exports rising steadily from that month until mid-May.  This was happening just as Saudi Arabia was making additional voluntary production cuts, prompting some markets watchers to conclude that the kingdom was shouldering most of the burden of balancing the global crude market. While Riyadh has never publicly questioned the veracity of Moscow’s output claims, it has urged more transparency.  Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said last week in Vienna that Russia’s announcement on August oil flows was “more meaningful” because it applied to exports.  Russian oil producers will decide on their own whether they need to make extra output cuts in August, but the nation’s task is to reduce exports next month, Tass citedBloomberg Terminal Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak as saying in Krasnoyarsk. “We’ll load less, Russia will supply less to oil markets,” he said.    Seaborne shipments of Russian crude are starting to show signs of falling. Exports from the country’s western ports in the four weeks to July 9 dropped substantially below their average February level for the first time, after volumes surged during the intervening months, according to vessel tracking data monitored by Bloomberg and corroborated by other data sources. Rystad Energy A/S expects Russia’s daily seaborne oil shipments next month to drop to 3.1 million to 3.2 million barrels, compared with about 3.7 million barrels in April and May. Less crude will be loaded onto tankers for export because of a “seasonal increase in refinery utilization” within the country, according to the consultant’s senior oil markets analyst Viktor Kurilov. Setting the pattern for August, Russia’s downstream facilities are already churning through crudeBloomberg Terminal. As of early July, the domestic oil-processing rates reached a 12-week high, according to Bloomberg calculations based on industry statistics.  Those refineries are receiving state subsidies for selling some of their gasoline and diesel at home that averaged $1 billionBloomberg Terminal a month in the first half of the year, according to Bloomberg calculations based on the ministry’s data.  When Russia’s Novak announced the 500,000 barrel-a-day export cut he didn’t give a baseline for the adjustment. That makes it difficult to assess how much crude the country will actually ship overseas in August, and the resulting impact on prices.  “It comes down to how many Russian barrels get removed,” said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst at UBS Group AG. “If the baseline is the May exports, the impact will likely be modest” because shipments in that month were so high, he said.  If Russia offsets the reduction in crude exports with an increase in shipments of refined fuels from its domestic refineries, the effect could be even more modest, he said. Oil has risen since Moscow and Riyadh announced the August cuts. Russia’s flagship Urals crude topped $60 a barrel on Wednesday, breaching the price cap imposed by the G-7. Brent crude exceeded $80 a barrel for the first time since May, but the international benchmark is still down this year.      The window of opportunity for Russia to cut oil exports and yet keep output largely intact is short. The real test of Moscow’s willingness to sacrifice sales volumes will come in September. That’s when the nation’s Finance Ministry plans to cut by half the generous fuel subsidies and keep them curbed through 2026Bloomberg Terminal, according to Russian newspaper Kommersant.  This change will reduce the appetite for crude among domestic refiners, which will hardly be able to raise domestic prices of gasoline or diesel to compensate for the lost incentives, said Mikhail Turukalov, independent US-based oil-products analyst. As a result, Russian companies will be more interested in selling to international markets, provided the government doesn’t introduce export quotas, he said.  Russia’s refineries will also be at the peak of their fall maintenance season in mid-September, Turukalov said. At that point, the country’s daily crude-processing may drop to 4.76 million to 5.1 million barrels, compared to 5.35 million to 5.57 million in August, he estimated, based on preliminary maintenance plans of the facilities. These factors would make it more painful for Russia to extending its export cuts beyond August, according to Kpler and Rystad Energy. Curbing overseas shipments in September “would require further production cuts,” Rystad’s Kurilov said. “As we have seen, Russia cannot do that quickly.” ']\n",

      "['A higher-than-expected India inflation reading in June has prompted some economists to raise their forecasts for consumer price gains for the year, cementing expectations the central bank will take more time to pivot to rate cuts.  Barclays Bank Plc sees the consumer price inflation averaging 5% in the fiscal year that ends March 2024, up from 4.7% earlier. Yes Bank has revised its estimated to 5.3%, while Emkay Global Financial Services sees it at 5.2%. The projections take the number closer to the upper end of the Reserve Bank of India’s 2%-6% target band.  Surging prices of vegetables and pulses pushed up inflation to a three-month high of 4.81% last month, ending four months of moderation. The outcome was predicted by only one of the 35 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Read: Surging Food Prices Push Up India Inflation to 3-Month High “The recent spike in food prices may caution the RBI, but we expect it to stay on hold for an extended period, without dropping its guard on inflation,” Barclays economists led by Rahul Bajoria wrote in a research report. “We are now tracking July CPI inflation at 5.5%, with perishable food prices the key upside risk.”  In comparison, the RBI’s inflation forecast is 5.1% for the year. The central bank paused from rate tightening in April as inflation showed signs of easing, but wants it firmly under control before switching to rate cuts to support growth. Emkay economist Madhavi Arora said there’s little the “RBI can do in the food supply management but this adds pressure on them to stay vigilant on domestic dynamics.” Yes Bank economists Indranil Pan and Deepthi Mathew echoed similar views, saying “the pressure on vegetable and pulses prices can continue due to the uneven monsoons.” What Bloomberg Economics Says... “Our base case remains inflation averaging just 5.2% in fiscal 2024, significantly lower than the 6.7% reported in fiscal 2023. That decline will likely be the result of lower commodity prices and lagged impacts from RBI rate hikes.

Shares of IMAX China Holdings Inc. surged the most in more than two years on Tuesday and were subsequently halted, two days before a take-private dealBloomberg Terminal was announced. NWS Holdings Ltd. shares posted their biggest gain in a year on June 23, before news of a buyout offer emerged four days later. The abnormally large swings prior to official announcements raised alarm bells on trading desks about the potential of nefarious buying on advanced knowledge of the deals. While Hong Kong’s market is no stranger to mysterious stock moves, past episodes were mostly limited to small-cap firms. “Disappointingly, this situation often occurs in Hong Kong’s stock market,” said Mike Leung, investment manager at Hong Kong-based brokerage Wocom Securities Ltd. “Clearly, the level of confidentiality has been insufficient, and there are suspicions of insider trading. There have been few successful enforcement examples in the past, which may worsen the situation.” Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. representatives declined to comment. Representatives at the Securities and Futures Commission, IMAX China and NWS didn’t respond to requests for comment.   An analysis from H/Advisors showed Asia Pacific was the most porous region last year for leaked deals, with more than half the transactions seeping out prior to an official announcement. Western Europe was ranked next at around 48%, followed by the US at 28%. Trading data for both IMAX China and NWS “looks suspicious” and may likely draw the attention of the city’s securities watchdog, said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer at private equity firm Kaiyuan Capital. IMAX China and NWS both had the highest trading volumes in months before their deals were announced. The SFC in March launched a regime which requires investors to have their personal identification details registered with the stock exchange, as it seeks to tighten oversight on trading activities and reduce market misconduct. That may help regulators “investigate related illegal activities promptly and effectively,” said Wocom Securities’ Leung, adding that more successful prosecutions will enhance deterrence of insider trading.']\n",

      "['Australia’s government risks compromising the Reserve Bank’s independence if it names a career bureaucrat as the next governor, opposition leader Peter Dutton said, with an announcement due by the end of the month. Candidates considered frontrunners to replace incumbent Philip Lowe include the head of the Department of Finance Jenny Wilkinson and Treasury chief Steven Kennedy. But Dutton, leader of the center-right Liberal Party, said the government shouldn’t name someone who has worked closely with it. “We’ve gone through the independence of that position, and it shouldn’t be compromised by a quasi-political appointment by the treasurer or the prime minister,” Dutton said Thursday. “It needs to be somebody who is independent and has the best interests of the Australian public in mind.”  Lowe’s seven-year term expires in mid-September and Treasurer Jim Chalmers said Wednesday that he intends to take a recommendation on the governor to Cabinet “soon,” declining to specify a date to avoid pre-empting discussions. The announcement would “ideally” come immediately after that, he said. While the government isn’t obliged to take the opposition’s views into account, Chalmers has sought a degree of bipartisanship on the central bank. He shared the recommendations of a recent review of the RBA with shadow treasurer Angus Taylor and said on Wednesday he’d had preliminary discussions with his opposition counterpart on the governor’s position. Dutton’s intervention therefore opens up the possibility of a political struggle over a position that’s supposed to be beyond the divide of politics. RBA to Cut Meetings as Lowe Says Further Rate Hikes May Be Needed Australian Treasurer to Finalize RBA Governor With Cabinet ‘Soon’ While the current governor could have his term extended — his two predecessors received an additional three years — antagonism toward Lowe is strong and he seems unlikely to be reappointed. The last RBA chief to come from outside the central bank’s ranks was Bernie Fraser, who shifted from Treasury in 1989. He established the 2-3% inflation target and laid the ground for RBA independence that was formalized in 1996. In addition to Wilkinson and Kennedy, Deputy Governor Michele Bullock is also a likely contender for the top job. Other names raised include former RBA No. 2 Guy Debelle, who resigned in March last year to take up a role in the green energy industry. While Lowe has been a lightning rod for criticism among left-wing lawmakers and sections of the public, he has garnered support from opposition finance ministry spokesperson Jane Hume, who earlier this month called for the governor to be extended. Lowe faced widespread criticism for forward guidance delivered during the pandemic that interest rates were unlikely to rise before 2024. Instead, as inflation spiked, the RBA began hiking in May 2022 and has now increased borrowing costs by a cumulative 4 percentage points, its most aggressive tightening cycle in more than 30 years. Liberal Party Senator Andrew Bragg said that the lengthy process over whether to renew Lowe may have hurt Australia’s “capacity to restrain inflation.” He accused the government of running a “personal” campaign against Lowe and said jettisoning the governor wouldn’t help efforts to bring consumer prices under control. Australia’s inflation rate was 7% in the first three months of the year and second-quarter data is due on July 26. “A governor has not been removed during a tightening cycle,” Bragg said Wednesday in a statement. “We must not undo 30 years of RBA independence.”']\n",

The agreement, reached at a Jakarta court, involves as much as 7.3 trillion rupiah ($488 million) of debt, with maturities between 8 and 15 years, the airline’s lawyers saidBloomberg Terminal in a statement Wednesday. Under the plan, Sriwijaya will seek new strategic investment and it may include an initial public offering. “This can reduce financial debt by around 80%,” the airline’s financial consultant Noprian Fadli at Triple B Advisory said in the statement. The development highlights how the pandemic continues to occupy airlines and lenders after the slump in travel caused debt to mount. Flag carrier PT Garuda Indonesia also went through a $9.8 billion debt restructuring in 2022. Garuda took over Sriwijaya’s operations in 2018 to expedite its debt restructuring, but the agreement ended within a year. Sriwijaya owed Garuda about $37 million as of the end of March.  Covid’s impact on travel piled further pressure on Sriwijaya, as did a crash in January 2021, when all 62 people on board a domestic flight were killed.  Air travel has recovered fast since Covid restrictions were lifted. Latest figures from the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines show international passenger traffic in the region was up 193% in May from a year earlier.']\n",

      "['Barclays Securities pushed back its forecast for when the Bank of Japan is likely to tweak its yield curve control program, while financial markets signal some signs of wariness that change could take place later this month.  “The BOJ has taken a clear behind-the-curve stance and does not appear compelled at this stage to revise YCC based on the current improvements in wage and price indicators,” Tetsufumi Yamakawa, chief Japan economist at Barclays, wrote in a note Thursday.

The shifts point to the possibility that other economists may also be rethinking their forecasts. In last month’s Bloomberg surveyBloomberg Terminal of BOJ watchers, July was the most popular timing for a policy shift.  One complication for analysts is that the central bank likely won’t hint at tweaking its yield curve control in advance, in order to avoid any major bond selloffs before they’ve actually made any change to policy. “We are no longer sufficiently confident in a July BOJ adjustment to make it our base case, though we certainly would not rule it out,” BofA economists Izumi Devalier and Takayasu Kudo wrote in a report Monday.  Still, some financial market indicators suggest an emerging sense of caution over the possibility that the central bank may tweak its yield control this month.

      "['The executive responsible for the Nordic operations of BNP Paribas SA says the region’s property crisis won’t trigger a financial collapse to match that of the 1990s owing to a much stronger banking system.  “If you speak to the local banks that have quite a lot of real estate exposure, I can’t see anyone panicking really,” BNP’s Nordic Chief Executive Officer Eirik Winter said in an interview. Lenders in Sweden, where Winter is based, have come under increasing scrutiny over the real estate risks on their loan books amid a plunge in home prices and the struggles of commercial landlords as they race to refinance a $17 billion wall of maturing bond debt over the next 18 months. Above-average property exposures have prompted a raft of analysts, from JPMorgan Chase & Co to Barclays Plc, to warn of the potential losses facing the region’s banking sector, and last week Moody’s Investors Service signaled it may lower the credit rating on Svenska Handelsbanken AB if the fallout worsens. Swedish Real Estate Woes Pile Pressure on Handelsbanken’s Rating JPMorgan Analysts Sound Alarm on Swedish Banks Property RiskBloomberg Terminal Nordic Property Woes May Pose $4 Billion Risk for Region’s BanksBloomberg Terminal While Winter admits he has “a little bit of a chilling feeling of deja vu” when it comes to the ongoing property slump in Sweden, he says there are key differences between now and 30 years ago — when a housing crash sparked widespread collapse across the Nordic nation’s banking industry. “The banking system is strong and it’s in everyone’s interest not to have any major disasters,” he said. “I think this will be solved over time.” Winter, who’s been running the Nordic business since 2018 with close to 1,000 employees in the region, points to the “diversified capital structures and aggressive divestment programs” of Swedish property companies as further positives. Nor are the real estate woes having a detrimental effect on BNP’s business in this part of Europe, according to Winter. “We’ve been picking up in our cash management business,” he said. “The same goes for our loan portfolio, and investment-grade bond activity has been as hot as ever.” Areas that have taken a hit amid the volatility are the markets for new share listings and dealmaking, however. “The M&A market is driven by sentiment and when there’s insecurity in the world, people are not pulling the trigger on very big transactions,” Winter said.']\n",

      "['China is facing pressure on trade as foreign shipments drop off and domestic demand remains weak, with a darkening global growth outlook and geopolitical tensions making a reprieve unlikely anytime soon. The country’s exports fell 12.4% in dollar terms in June from a year earlier, the customs administration said Thursday. That was the second straight month of declines and the biggest drop since the pandemic hit in early 2020. Imports slumped 6.8%, the customs data showed.  That left a trade surplus of $70.6 billion for the month. Economists had forecast that exports would drop 10% while imports would shrink 4.1%. Global demand had been a strong driver of China’s growth over the past three years, although that began to fade in late 2022. Exports have now fallen for four of the six months so far in 2023. As global growth slows and as many central banks still seem poised to raise interest rates to push down inflation, it appears increasingly unlikely that foreign demand for Chinese goods will be able to help the world’s second-largest economy as its rebound falters. “We see little respite for China’s exports in the second half, as the US is likely to enter a mild recession, while the Eurozone economy probably will remain weak,” Duncan Wrigley, chief China economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note after the data release.   “The risk of an escalating technology trade war with the US cannot be ruled out,” Wrigley said. He noted that Beijing’s export restrictions on gallium and germanium, which are used in the semiconductor and electric-vehicle industries, will take effect from next month. The weakness in export demand was widespread. Exports to the US fell almost 24%, the 11th straight month of declines and the worse result since the slump at the beginning of the pandemic.  Shipments to Asean, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Germany, Italy, the UK, the Netherlands and Canada all fell by double digits, and shipments to France were also down.  “External uncertainties are rising, and the global economy’s weak momentum and outlook of slowing growth is not improving yet,” said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of strategy for Greater China at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.  “The impact from unleashing earlier pent-up orders is basically gone,” although exports of goods such as electric cars and batteries continues to improve, he said. China’s shares rose on Thursday as Asia equities broadly gained. The mainland’s benchmark CSI 300 Index closed 1.4% higher, the biggest increase in a month, while Chinese shares traded in Hong Kong climbed 2.6% as of 3:55 p.m. local time. The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.1658 per dollar. The import dataBloomberg Terminal underscores the weakness of the domestic economy and the impact of the tech war with the US and its allies. Demand in China for electronic parts from Taiwan and South Korea, along with commodities from elsewhere, is still down. Soybean, copper ore and concentrated copper, iron ore and natural gas importsBloomberg Terminal all fell from May.  That has left the nation’s trade increasingly unbalanced, with the surplus in the first six months at a record for that period in data back through the late 1990s.  “The deeper decline in China’s exports in June drives home a painful message — a global economy that’s weakening won’t offer much support for China’s struggling recovery. A bigger drop in imports highlights weakening domestic demand — and the need for forceful policy support.” Eric Zhu, economist See hereBloomberg Terminal for full report. “The weakening external demand continues to impact China’s trade,” said Lyu Daliang, spokesman of the the General Administration of Customs. “The global economy’s recovery is lacking a driver. Global trade and investment is slowing, while unilateralism, protectionism and geopolitical risks are rising.” The government is looking to increase stimulus to support domestic growth — and the trajectory of global demand through the rest of the year will be an important factor for Beijing to determine how much help is needed. “Take trade and other data together, we see reasonable chance of measured stimulus,” said Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Plc. He expects imports to outperform exports in the second half of the year on a moderate domestic recovery, and commodity prices to be less of a drag.']\n",

      "['A week after the US two-year yield topped 5% en route to its highest levels since 2007, the mood has changed completely and bond bulls are mapping out a course for 4%, if not lower.  The prospect that a slowdown in inflation will allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner and more deeply than markets are currently pricing in should allow the two-year rate to reach that level this year, according to Pendal Group Ltd and TD Securities.  The shortest-maturity Treasury note’s yield dipped below 4.62% to the lowest level in nearly a month Thursday after a gauge of wholesale prices was softer than expected. On Wednesday, data showed US consumer price inflation eased at a faster-than-expected pace in June, sparking a 13-basis-point drop in two-year yields, the biggest since May.  “Inflation has been such a big problem for the past year, and we’ve stepped down into a new zip code,” said Amy Xie Patrick, head of income strategies at Pendal in Sydney. She’s been favoring two-year Treasuries “on the likelihood that the Fed will cut sooner and more aggressively than definitely what they say, but also than what the market currently prices.”  Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US interest-rate strategy at TD, forecasts a 3.95% two-year yield at year-end. US core CPI inflation slowed to 4.8% last month, the lowest since 2021. That ignited rallies in bonds and stocks and a slide in the dollar as investors unwound bets that the Fed would raise rates again following an expected hike this month. Those moves continued into Thursday.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s favored gauge of inflation — which measures core services excluding rents — slowed to a 1.4% annual pace based on its three-month annualized trend. That underscores the likelihood that this slowdown in price pressures is sustainable, Xie Patrick said.  Fund Titans Are Betting on Everything Gaining Against the Dollar TD predicts a US recession in the first quarter and declining inflation leading the Fed to slash rates by 300 basis points next year. “We are looking for lower yields than most as we have a lot of Fed rate cuts penciled in for 2024,” Goldberg said in a telephone interview Thursday. Assuming a quarter-point hike in July that brings the range for the policy rate to 5.25%-5.5%, the cuts TD expects would bring it back to 2.25%-2.5%. A 300-basis-point drop “may seem like a very large number, but in a historical context that’s a very small cutting cycle,” he said. Swaps contracts that attempt to predict Fed moves see a July hike as a near-certainty, and roughly one-in-four odds of an additional one. They price in a quarter-point cut no sooner than March and around 160 basis points of easing in 2024.']\n",

      "['New Zealand has less than 10 years of natural gas available in its existing fields, raising questions about the security of future energy supply. The nation’s proven and probable gas reserves fell 17% to 1,635 petajoules at the end of 2022, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment said Thursday in Wellington. The decline reflects gas use of 145 petajoules last year plus revisions to estimated reserves, it said. “Estimated gas reserves have now dropped below 10 years of remaining use for the first time, based on an average gas use of 200 petajoules over the last ten years,” the ministry said. Even though gas use is less than that, and declining, production is expected to drop below 2022 gas use in 2027, it said. New Zealand is trying to curb the use of fossil fuels by subsidizing the take up of electric vehicles and the replacement of coal-fired boilers. The government banned new offshore oil and gas exploration in 2018 and it wants electricity generation to become 100% renewable by 2030. The opposition National Party has pledged to lift the exploration ban if it wins the October election. Currently more than 80% of power comes from hydro, wind and geothermal sources with the remainder largely gas-fired generation, which provides security when lake storage levels drop. Gas “is a vital component in our energy mix and picks up the slack when weather-dependent renewables cannot get there on their own,” said John Carnegie, chief executive of Energy Resources Aotearoa, which represents gas explorers and users. “What affordable alternative renewable energy source at scale can possibly fill the gap now forecast to emerge in less than eight years’ time? Alarm bells should be ringing.” The ministry said gas use fell in 2022 due in part to the mothballing of Methanex Corp.’s methanol plant, closure of the Marsden Point oil refinery and a decline in gas use for electricity generation due to favorable conditions for hydro. It said future measures of reserves can be increased by converting so-called contingent reserves to proven reserves. However, there was also a 41% drop in contingent reserves in 2022.']\n",

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority proposed to increase the amount of savings covered by the government guarantee in the event of bank failure to HK$800,000 ($102,272) per depositor at each Hong Kong bank, up from HK$500,000, a consultation paperBloomberg Terminal showed Thursday. Changes to the scheme, which covers both individuals and corporate account holders, are expected to take effect from the start of 2025.  This review will “ensure the scheme remains effective in maintaining banking stability and to keep up with international best practice,” said Daryl Ho, Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board Chief Executive Officer and the executive director at the HKMA.  Recent US bank failures reignited a debate around the world on savers’ protections, schemes where governments guarantee to pay depositors in the rare event of a bank collapsing. While the majority of large countries offer such a backstop, the demise of Silicon Valley Bank indicated a shortfall in the depositor protection program for smaller institutions.  Hong Kong is attempting a revival from years-long Covid restrictions that saw talent and capital leave. The domestic economy and its stock market are showing scant signs of a recovery six months after borders reopened, as data signaled the wider China economy is struggling. Last week the city relaxed some of its residential mortgage rules, allowing buyers a smaller down payment. This review was initiated in 2021 and wasn’t prompted by recent banking events in the US and Europe, said Connie Lau, chairman of the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board. After the change, some 92.2% of depositors will be covered, up from 88.6% at present, the HKMA said. That compares with international guidance of 90%, it said.

Varun Beverages Ltd., which says it’s responsible for about 90% of PepsiCo sales in India, is set to profit from the expanded distribution of its products to remoter parts of the country, while sales should also benefit from the trend toward increasing temperatures, analysts say. “This quarter will be good for Varun as this season is the best for them,” said Lavita Lasrado, an equity research analyst at Mirae Asset Capital Markets India Pvt. in Mumbai. “Their growth is organic and they have been adding capacity.” Varun has a history of getting a kickstart from its earnings announcement. The company’s quarterly revenue has beaten the Bloomberg average analyst estimate on 20 of the past 23 occasions, while shares have risen an average 7.4% in the month following its results.  Beverage sales are likely to have increased in recent months as much of India sweltered in a heat wave, with temperatures soaring as high as 46C (115F).

      "['“We are opportunistic, but still quite selective in equities positioning.” Julia Wang, executive director and global market strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, discusses her investment strategy and her outlook for China. She speaks on Bloomberg Television. On June 16, the same day Secretary of State Antony Blinken was set to fly to Beijing for meetings with senior Chinese officials, the State Department he oversees reported anomalous activity to Microsoft that the tech firm later blamed on China-based hackers. It was Blinken’s second try at making the high-profile trip. His first attempt in February was derailed at the last minute by the discovery of an alleged Chinese spy balloon floating above the US — which President Joe Biden ordered shot down by the US Air Force. This time, the Biden administration is staying the course on its China-engagement strategy, continuing the string of contact with Beijing that began with Blinken. But the hacking episode underlines the growing risks of restarting crucial diplomatic engagement between the world’s two largest economies when geopolitical competition between Washington and Beijing remains as fierce as ever.   Blinken’s trip last month — the most senior US delegation to China in five years — was only the first of several visits aimed at trying to reestablish more durable diplomatic links that China mostly severed in the wake of then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s controversial stop in Taiwan. China responded to Pelosi’s trip by holding unprecedented military drills around Taiwan. Similar exercises were held in April, when Taiwan’s leader, Tsai Ing-wen, met House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the US.   “At the end of the day, they get to decide whether they’re gonna do these meetings or not, and they seem to be feeling they want to put some skin in the game to see where this can lead,” said Christopher Johnson, the president of China Strategies Group, a political risk consultancy, and a former senior China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency.  “If something really significant were to happen, like a mash-up in the South China Sea or something bad, then obviously that would be it. But I think garden-variety cyber and stuff like that, I don’t think that’s enough,” he added. China has shown a similar commitment. Beijing shrugged off Biden’s reference to Xi as a “dictator” days after Blinken’s visit, still welcoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in China weeks later. US climate envoy John Kerry is set to arrive in Beijing on Sunday.  Blinken raised the issue of hacking on Thursday in a meeting with China’s top foreign policy official Wang Yi on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations foreign ministers meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, a senior State Department official told reporters.  The agency wouldn’t say if Blinken had raised the latest incident, which included the alleged breach of the email account of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Before the revelations, she’d been both one of those seeking to visit China as part of the engagement efforts and a leading figure in the administration’s moves to limit Beijing’s access to high-tech semiconductors and chip-making equipment. The hack that was revealed this week was a “sophisticated” example of China’s increasingly advanced cyber abilities, according to George Barnes, the deputy director of the US National Security Agency. It was “yet another example of what is happening around us every day,” he told a conference of intelligence professionals in Maryland on Thursday. “China is steadfast and determined to penetrate our government, our companies, our critical infrastructure.”  China routinely accuses the US of hacking. The Foreign Ministry in Beijing this week called the US “the world’s biggest hacking empire and global cyber thief,” and asked for Washington to explain its own activities. Amid the continuing current of irritants in the relationship with China, Republican lawmakers have stepped up criticism of Biden’s diplomatic strategy. Mike Gallagher, who chairs a House select committee on competition with China, derides it as “zombie engagement.”   On Thursday, Gallagher’s committee announced a hearing next week on the Biden administration’s China strategy that will see will see three senior policy appointees appear as witnesses: Ely Ratner, the assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs; Daniel Kritenbrink, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs; and Thea Rozman Kendler, the assistant secretary of commerce for export administration. Earlier this week, Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, issued a subpoena to Blinken for documents related to the administration’s moves against China. Using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China, he accused the State Department of “continued weakness and passivity in the face of PRC aggression.”  The administration rejects that criticism, highlighting the numerous sanctions and other export controls that it’s imposed.  “One of the things we heard over and over from Chinese officials is their deep protests and their deep complaints about the competitive actions that we have taken,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday.']\n",

      "['New Zealand’s manufacturing industry has contracted for a fourth consecutive month, the most sustained downturn since 2009. The Performance of Manufacturing Index fell to 47.5 in June from a revised 48.7 in May, Business New Zealand and Bank of New Zealand said Thursday in Wellington. The index was also below 50, indicating a contraction, in March and April. The PMI has been lower. It fell to 39 in August 2021 in the midst of the Covid-19 lockdown, and spent three months at or below 40 in early 2020 — including a plunge to 26 — when the virus first arrived in New Zealand.  But the gauge hasn’t shown four or more months of contraction since a 14-month slump that ended in August 2009, when the economy was emerging from recession following the global financial crisis. “Four in a row is a message that manufacturing is struggling,” said Craig Ebert, senior economist at BNZ in Wellington. “Manufacturing output fell in the first-quarter GDP report. Today’s PMI does suggest production has fallen again in the second quarter.” Manufacturing has come under pressure as cost-of-living increases and high interest rates curb consumer demand. The economy contracted in the final months of 2022 and the first quarter of this year, and while it may have stabilized in the second quarter, three of the nation’s biggest banks predict another recession will start later this year. Second-quarter GDP data won’t be reported until mid-September and there is a lot of data to emerge on consumer spending, exports and construction before analysts finalize their forecasts. BNZ is provisionally tipping 0.3% growth. Ebert said while the PMI paints “a fairly scratchy picture” for manufacturing across the board, it doesn’t reflect the heavy weighting that sectors such as food and beverage have in the GDP data. A strong end to the dairy season in May and good autumn weather for meat producers may yet provide a boost to manufacturing output in the quarter, he said.']\n",

      "['China’s tech stocks gained for a fourth day in Hong Kong as growing signs that the government’s long crackdown on the sector is finally over bolstered investor confidence. The latest leg of the rally came after Chinese Premier Li Qiang met with senior executives from country’s leading tech firms Wednesday and urged local governments to provide more support to the enterprises. He asked the companies to support the real economy through innovation and pledged that officials will create a fair environment and reduce compliance costs.  The Hang Seng Tech Index jumped 3.8%, extending this week’s gains to more than 8%. Among the best performers, Bilibili Inc. and Kuaishou Technology climbed at least 7.5%. The gains tracked the 3.4% rally in the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index. The comments from Li “signify that the Chinese authorities are turning to mega-cap internet companies as an instrument to pursue industrial policies, create employment, and attempt to tackle choke points in critical technology,” said Redmond Wong, strategist at Saxo Capital Markets HK Ltd. Chinese regulators last week imposed more than $1 billion of fines on Ant Group Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., a move widely interpreted as closure to the regulatory assault that had wiped out billions in market value from the sector in recent years. Read more: China Ends Tech Crackdown With Fines on Tencent, Ant Group Representatives from food delivery platform Meituan and Xiaohongshu Technology Co., a popular Chinese Instagram-like social media platform, also spoke at Wednesday’s meeting with Premier Li, while JD.com Inc. and budget shopping platform PDD Holdings Inc. submitted written speeches, state broadcaster CCTV reported. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, a broader gauge of major mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, climbed 2.6%. Market sentiment has improved this week after Chinese authorities extended some loan relief measures for property developers and state-run newspapers flagged the likelihood of further supportive measures to boost business confidence.  Many investors had grown tired of waiting for the government’s crackdown on the private sector to end, even as the economy struggled to gain momentum. Overseas fundsBloomberg Terminal cut holdings of Chinese and Hong Kong equities in June, while mainland investors sold a net HK$5.8 billion ($741 million) of Hong Kong shares in June, the first month of net outflows since November, according to exchange data.  The Chinese government is sending a “friendly gesture” to technology companies, said Willer Chen, senior analyst at Forsyth Barr Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Key signal sending from the government is still hoping that platform companies will create more jobs, maintaining international competitiveness and helping real economy.”']\n",

      "['Australia’s pensions giants, flush with cash thanks to surging inflows, are looking to private markets for discount deals as global asset prices come under pressure. The A$85 billion ($58 billion) Construction & Building Unions Superannuation Fund is seeking to invest cash holdings that are “more than double” usual levels, according to new Chief Investment Officer Brett Chatfield. The fund joins rivals AustralianSuper Pty and Australian Retirement Trust in hunting quality assets as the industry rakes in more than A$1 billion a week in inflows. Cbus is “very actively looking for opportunities,” Chatfield said in an interview Monday, citing private debt as a key area of interest “where we still think returns are fairly attractive.” The fund’s boost in firepower has partly come from selling off some equities, particularly overvalued US stocks. Other areas of buying interest are infrastructure and property assets including office, retail and industrial buildings, as well as sectors overseas such as medical offices and multifamily residential, he said.  Aware Super, with A$160 billion of assets, has a “substantial amount” of cash to deploy on selective deals, Chief Investment Officer Damian Graham said in an interview. The fund is currently looking at opportunities in digital infrastructure, the clean energy transition and retirement living after recently buying a stake in a UK build-to-rent developer. “We’re always thinking about making sure we’ve got enough liquidity in the portfolio so that we can be a buyer where we see distress, where we see opportunities,” said Graham. “If we do see a more meaningful recession or even if we see assets start to have to be sold for various reasons, we want to be able to lean into that.” Australia’s pensions sector needs to deploy cash that’s pouring in from the nation’s compulsory retirement contributions that this month rose to 11% of workers’ salaries. The funds have plowed into private markets in recent years as they scout for returns beyond their own backyard, and are now seeking fresh opportunities as worsening economic conditions trigger the repricing of assets at home and abroad. The sector is also enjoying a rebound in returns after enduring one of its worst performances ever in 2022. The funds’ default investment options returned an average 8.5% for the year through June, compared with -3.4% in the previous financial year, according to research house SuperRatings.  Australian Retirement Trust, with more than A$240 billion under management, said that property was still one of the “most exciting ways” to diversify away from traditional assets. That’s despite the fund, along with peers including Cbus, seeing write downs from office properties as commercial property woes linger.  “We’re quite comfortable investing into specific pockets of alternative property in the right markets where we can see the sort of demographic tailwinds that will give us some inflation protection looking forward,” ART Head of Investment Strategy Andrew Fisher said in an interview.  ART is continuing to look at alternative property sectors including multifamily developments, retirement villages and caravan parks in the US, he said. It’s also considering opportunities in the student accommodation, health care and self-storage sectors.  Australia’s Top Pension Looks to Spend Cash Pile as Rates Bite AustralianSuper, the nation’s biggest pension with A$300 billion under management, is similarly poised for good deals. It has around 10% of those funds available for when asset prices improve. “We’re starting to warehouse or build up cash with the idea that we can deploy that into other investments as pricing gets better over the next two to three years,” Chief Investment Officer Mark Delaney said in an interview last week, adding some of that cash had already been spent on bonds.   “The impact of high interest rates will eventually create opportunities and we want to be in a position to take advantage of them,” he said.']\n",

      "['Economists have called an end to New Zealand’s housing slump, saying latest data show the market has found a floor and prices are starting to recover. A Real Estate Institute of New Zealand report released Thursday in Wellington shows house prices rose 0.4% in June while sales continued to recover. Economists at ANZ Bank, Westpac, ASB Bank and Kiwibank all said the report is the latest sign that housing demand is starting to outstrip supply amid record immigration.  “The turning point in the house price cycle has arrived,” said Miles Workman, senior economist at ANZ Bank New Zealand in Wellington.  Satish Ranchhod, senior economist at Westpac in Auckland, concurred. “The latest update from REINZ reinforced the sense that New Zealand’s housing market has found a base, with both sales and prices pushing higher,” he said. New Zealand house prices have dropped almost 18% from their peak in November 2021 as the central bank hiked interest rates aggressively to tame inflation. While mortgage rates aren’t expected to drop any time soon, they aren’t seen rising much further after the Reserve Bank yesterday reinforced the view that its tightening cycle has ended. The REINZ report showed house prices fell 9% in the year through June, but the median price has recovered to NZ$780,000 ($491,000) from a low of NZ$762,000 in February. Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr said it appears that most, if not all, of the housing market correction has now played out. “The peak in interest rates will mark the bottom of the downturn,” he said, adding that surging immigration and the prospect of rate cuts on the horizon should fuel a housing rebound. “We see a return to monthly house price gains — albeit very modest gains — beginning from the second half of the year,” Kerr said. ANZ expects prices will lift about 3% in the second half, while Westpac and ASB also expect increases.  “With mortgage rates close to peaking, supply stabilizing and stronger population growth of late, prices can make further gains over the coming months,” ASB economist Nathaniel Keall said. “But we think this upswing will look different to the last one, with prices recovering slowly rather than galloping away.”']\n",

      "['A Taiwanese firm has sold the island’s biggest Japan equity fund, reflecting local investors’ keen demand for their neighbor’s booming share market as they retreat from China.   Yuanta Securities Investment Trust Co., Taiwan’s largest fund company by assets managed, gathered its targeted NT$20 billion ($638 million) by Friday after a week of public offering, a company statement shows. That also makes it the biggest of any of the island’s funds targeting foreign equities, according to industry group SITCA data. The strong demand for Japanese shares coincides with investors’ pullback from Chinese stocks as the world’s second-largest economy struggles to recover, while US-China tensions over Taiwan show little signs of abating. Yuanta’s Japan fund provides an alternative for Taiwan investors, betting on companies including technology firms and medical device makers as the share market of Asia’s No. 2 economy touches three-decade highs. “The impression of Japan has largely been about tourism” among Taiwanese people, said Julian Liu, chairman of Taipei-based Yuanta in an interview. “But with more understanding of Japan’s economy, industries and companies, investors can now earn capital gains through investing in Japan.” China remains the second-most popular overseas destination for Taiwanese investors after the US, but their holdings are declining: the island’s funds cut their China exposure by 14.6%, the equivalent of NT$39.2 billion this year, according to Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission data as of May. Taiwan banks’ exposure to China also dropped to NT$1.05 trillion as May, a 15% decrease from a year earlier. Investors are turning away from China due to its sluggish economy, as seen in weak consumer spending, a rickety property market and lackluster exports. Tensions between the world’s two biggest economies are also discouraging investors, with Chinese warplanes flying this week into sensitive areas around Taiwan the latest example of that. “With the change in the political and economic situation in China, we must rethink an alternative market outside of China,” said Liu, whose firm oversees NT$1.12 trillion of assets, making it the largest fund company in Taiwan, according to SITCA data as of May.  Liu has chosen Japan as the next “core market” given the importance of the world’s third-largest economy and its close ties with Taiwan as a trading partner. Japan can help offset previous positions in China, and the market’s strong fundamentals present more long-term investment potential than before, he said. Warren Buffett’s investment in Japanese trading companies has prompted foreigners to flock into some of the nation’s large caps with global competitiveness. Liu’s fund has also identified “invisible champions” to watch within key sectors like precision industrials, medical devices, and tech firms related to chips, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. Taiwan’s investment habits have gradually changed from trading-driven to allocation-driven, said Liu, who also started Taiwan’s first ETF fund 20 years ago. Investing in Japan may help diversify portfolios and hedge risks, he said. Japan’s share market is “only back to where it was 30 years ago,” and that while some indexes “might have reached a high point, that’s not necessarily the case for stock prices of some companies,” Liu said.

      "['A $590 billion stock rally in India since late March is at risk of faltering as earnings face headwinds and retail investors pull back amid stretched valuations. Key gauges in India hit records in July on bets that Asia’s third-biggest economy will stage a strong recovery even with elevated policy rates. The rapid gains, which follow a 4% advance for the benchmark last year, have led Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and CLSA Ltd. to warn that the equities are looking expensive. Global funds may find better bargains in other emerging markets after pouring $13 billion into local stocks this year as domestic retail traders turn net sellers. “We do think that markets are not as attractive from a valuation standpoint as they were a quarter back,” said Rupal Agarwal, quantitative strategist at Sanford C. Bernstein. The MSCI India Index’s 12-month forward-earnings multiple has risen to near 21 times from 18.5 times just over three months ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s above its 10-year average and more than 50% higher than the valuation for the broader Asian gauge.  Here are three charts on the investment case for Indian stocks: CLSA said June 27 that valuations are “exceedingly rich” and analysts’ earnings expectations are too optimistic. The stocks were overbought by some 14%, by its modeling. Goldman’s analysts argued that valuations are expensive, and that there will be a consolidation in the third quarter. The BSE 500 Index, which covers 93% of India’s total market capitalization, traded slightly lower as of 2:45 pm in Mumbai. The valuation premium for stocks in the South Asian nation has risen sharply against that of emerging market, Asian and global peers. “In the short-term, the market has got stretched, so a 3-5% correction is on the cards,” said Atul Suri, a fund manager at Marathon Trends Advisory Pvt Ltd. Surging food prices due to adverse weather for crops would also delay any potential pivot by the central bank to cut rates. India’s retail inflation quickened more than estimated in June after four months of declines. Earnings growth for the MSCI India index saw its first downgrade last week after seven consecutive weeks of increases, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. “We think earnings estimates could be at risk with both consumption and exports slowing down and commodities being in deflation,” said Prateek Parekh, analyst at Nuvama Wealth Management Ltd.  Retail investors appear to be calling the top on the stock rally, net selling $1.4 billion of equities in May, according to data from the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. They have withdrawn net $530 million worth of shares this year through May 31, putting them on course for the first annual outflow since 2019 when they sold $3.1 billion of stocks, NSE data showed.  While the near-term rally in India may be at risk, strategists see continued appeal in India’s long-termBloomberg Terminal growth story driven “by a stable macro, the pace of reforms, infrastructure upgrades and the prospect of manufacturing and export-led growth, which could lift the potential growth of the country,” said Amit Sachdeva, equity strategist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets India Pvt Ltd.

      "['Investors in China’s local government financing vehicles are cutting the length of time they are prepared to extend credit and demanding higher returns, as cracks appear in the $9.1 trillion market. In the first half of 2023 the average tenor — the length of time before a debt matures — of onshore LGFV bond issuance fell to 2.51 years according to Bloomberg calculations. That’s down from 2.95 years in 2022 and the shortest since at least 1999 when the data series began.  Additionally, the average coupon on LGFV yuan bonds jumped to 4.39% in the first six months of the year from 3.94% last year despite the fact that China is easing monetary policy.  In another warning signal, China’s state pension fund, one of the country’s biggest investors, has advised asset managers that handle its money to sell some bonds including those from riskier LGFVs and private developers after a review, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday.  This increased investor caution points to looming refinancing challenges for a sector considered China’s top financial stability risk. If provinces are only able to refinance at less favorable rates, that may force them to scale back spending, dragging on China’s already spluttering economy. Moreover, if any were to miss these new higher payments, that could force a rapid repricing of credit and send borrowing costs soaring to unaffordable levels.  “Heavily relying on shorter-tenor bonds for financing will make these regions’ ability to refinance even more fragile,” said Zhao Guojun, credit analysis director at the fixed income department of Wanlian Securities Co. “If market sentiment weakens, there may be liquidity risks or technical defaults.” While no LGFV has yet defaulted on a public bond, the majority of regional governments face a severe funding crunch. The property slump has slashed income from land sales while public spending jumped during the pandemic. Half of cities experienced difficulty in managing debt interest payments last year, Rhodium Group said.  The new, more cautious, funding environment is particularly tough for weaker regions. Read More: Chinese City’s Roads to Nowhere Show Depth of Stimulus Challenge Take Qinghai, a sparsely populated western province. Its funding costs hit 7.1% this year, compared to just 3% for financial hub Shanghai, Bloomberg’s calculations show. Tianjin, a manufacturing center known for over-development, saw its average coupon jump nearly a percentage point in the first half of 2023. As well as higher costs, it’s these same regions that also have to borrow on shorter terms.  “It is hard for LGFV issuers to issue long-dated bonds, especially those in weaker areas,” said Janet Lu, head of fixed income China, Eastspring Investment Management (Shanghai) Co. “There’s also uncertainty on how the government policy in handling LGFV debt will evolve in the longer term.” In a reflection of the difficulties in rolling over debt, overall net refinancing fell 6.5% in the first half of the year. That could force LGFVs to turn to other channels to fill their funding gaps — and these are getting harder to find. Chinese banks recently stoppedBloomberg Terminal buying a type of debt called “free-trade-zone bonds” where LGFVs were the major issuers.   The underlying problem is most infrastructure projects built by LGFVs never generated enough money to cover their debts, relying instead on cash injections from local government and refinancing to stay afloat.  While LGFV bonds are classed as corporate debt, investors generally assume they are backed by an implicit government guarantee. LGFVs had about 13.5 trillion yuan of outstanding onshore bonds at the end of 2022, according to data from S&P Global Ratings — representing about 40% of China’s non-financial corporate bond market. The vast majority of that debt is held by domestic investors, spanning all types of financial institutions from commercial banks to insurers and mutual funds. That means any problems could ripple through the whole financial ecosystem.  Already there are concerns that banks may incur losses after some state-owned lenders started to offer additional credit support. Banks including Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and China Construction Bank Corp. are offering loans that mature in 25 years, instead of the prevailing 10-year tenor for most corporate lending, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg in July.  Despite all of these issues, there is still no panic in the market. Key spreads between yuan-denominated LGFV bonds and similar-maturity sovereign debt even narrowed earlier this year.  That’s partly because while the recent last-minute payment of a note raised concerns about the sector’s debt-servicing abilities, even struggling regions appear to be prioritizing timely bond payments.  “On a positive note, we have seen consistently strong support from local governments to these platforms to ensure timely repayment of bonds which we expect to continue at least in the short term,” said Eastspring’s Lu. Despite the central government’s attempts to discourage the idea it will bail out the sector if things go wrong, most investors fundamentally don’t believe it. Options for possible targeted intervention includeBloomberg Terminal the establishment of debt service funds to provide liquidity to weaker platforms or extending financing channels through state-owned companies. “The market is now expecting some policy measures from the central government,”said Moody’s Investors Service Associate Managing Director Ivan Chung. “If any of these debt problems leads to systemic risks or undermines social and economic stability, I think the central government will step in.” Data from 2022 onwards are calculated based on LGFV bonds issued by the end of 2021, on the assumption that LGFVs that have been set up since then don’t impact the data significantly.']\n",

      "['Wall Street got an extra dose of encouragement to bid up stocks after another inflation report reinforced bets the Federal Reserve is approaching an interest-rate peak. All of a sudden, disinflation becomes the buzzword across trading desks, with investors looking on the bright side of data showing a slowdown in prices — even though core inflation is still running above the central bank’s 2% target. Equities gained further traction on news that Fed Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard — who called for aggressive hikes — has resigned. Read: Stocks Took an 18-Month Round Trip From Tech Bear to AI Bull Tech megacaps led gains on Thursday, with the S&P 500 topping 4,500 and the Nasdaq 100 up over 1.5%. Amazon.com Inc. hit a 10-month high after reporting record sales during its Prime Day sale. Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. rallied about 4.5%. Banks also gained ahead of results from JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. Two-year yields fell 11 basis points to 4.64%. The dollar dropped for a fifth straight day. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.1% in June from a year earlier, the smallest advance since 2020. The figures came just a day after data showed consumer prices increased at the slowest pace since 2021. “The disinflation narrative is in full effect,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. “It does appear that inflation is coming down across the board, and although the Fed is still likely to raise rates again at the end of this month, there is a very strong possibility that they are done raising rates for the year.” Read: Bonds Are Hostage to an Elusive Neutral Rate That Keeps Shifting The recent economic figures have sent clear signals that the Fed’s policy is working, but it’s possibly too early to claim victory against inflation, according to Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index. “If I had to choose a camp, I would probably go in the two rate hikes to come – July and possibly another one later in the year,” Cincotta added. “And I think that there will be a growing number of Fed officials who will be questioning whether more rate hikes are actually needed after July.” Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly told CNBC Thursday that it’s too soon for policymakers to say they have done enough to return US inflation to their target. While the latest consumer-price report “is very positive,” the official said she’s in a “wait-and-see mode on that, because I remain resolute to bring inflation down to 2%.” Aside from the economic debate, traders also awaited the unofficial start of the second-quarter earnings season Friday. The focus is going to be mostly on the corporate outlooks given that beating profit expectations seems to be a low hurdleBloomberg Terminal — even as some estimates have started to rise slowly.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists expect US companies to be able to meet the low bar set by consensus. And Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Gina Martin Adams says “the S&P 500 earnings season will likely reveal more of the ‘less bad than feared’ trend that emerged in 1Q.” “The thing I’m focusing on in the market, of course, is earnings, to see where the numbers come in, to try to get a gauge on how companies are doing, and really what they’re forecasting going forward,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank. In other corporate news, Delta Air Lines Inc. said it will make more money this quarter than Wall Street anticipated as it reported better-than-predicted results for the prior three months. PepsiCo Inc. raised its sales and earnings estimates once again after a strong quarter. Exxon Mobil Corp. agreed to buy Denbury Inc. for $4.9 billion, its biggest acquisition in six years.

Purchasing the shares of Imax China Holding Inc. will save the parent company about $2 million in annual costs and add to earnings immediately, according to a statement Wednesday. Imax is offering to buy the shares at HK$10 each. Trading in the Hong Kong stock was suspended, with the shares last quoted at HK$9.12. The company said the bid represents a 49% premium over the 30-day average closing price. The Chinese subsidiary was established in 2011 as a corporate home for Imax’s expansion in that country.

The cinema chain operator has seen a revival of its business in China amid a mainland box office recovery following Beijing’s abrupt pivot from Covid Zero restrictions in late 2022. The company raked in $34 million in box office during the 6-day Chinese New Year holiday earlier this year — its highest ever during the period. China’s box office is recovering steadily despite a more sluggish return in overall consumption demand so far this year. Box office for the week of July 7 exceededBloomberg Terminal that of the same period in 2019 by over 60%, as an increasing number of new films hit the big screen at the beginning of summer vacation. Ticket sales also soared to the second-highest amount on record for the Dragon Boat Festival holiday in late June.']\n",

      "['Illinois reached a tentative deal to settle a nearly decade-long lawsuit that alleged about a dozen of the biggest US banks engaged in price fixing in the municipal bond market. The banks have offered to pay the state $68 million, according to Todd Schneider, an attorney who is representing plaintiff side. The proposal comes as Bank of America, Barclays Capital Inc., BMO Financial Corp., William Blair & Co. LLC, Citigroup Inc., Fifth Third Bancorp, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley were expected to go to trial in Illinois next month to face allegations they inflated the interest rates on certain types of municipal bonds to discourage investors from returning them for cash and colluded in setting the rates. Read more: Wall Street Banks Face $8 Billion in Muni Price-Fixing Claims Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley all declined to comment on the proposed settlement. Representatives from Bank of America, BMO, William Blair and Fifth Third didn’t respond to email requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Illinois Attorney General’s Office declined to comment. The case revolved around allegations that the banks, which acted as remarketing agents for long-term bonds with periodic rate adjustments, called variable-rate demand obligations or VRDOs, failed to get issuers the lowest possible interest rates on securities where rates were typically reset on a daily or weekly basis. This was allegedly done to discourage investors from returning them for cash. The market for VRDO debt has been shrinking since the financial crisis when in 2008 more than $115 billion of debt was sold to refinance both auction-rate and insured floating-rate debt, as the auction market froze and insurance companies were downgraded amid the chaos. “A $68 million settlement would be about 20% of the $349 million in damages sought by the Illinois plaintiff (before tripling). That’s a pretty good outcome for the defendant banks, especially if spread across the 8 of them,” said Elliott Stein of Bloomberg Intelligence. “And it signals that the other False Claims Act cases in California, New York and New Jersey are manageable for the banks too if they’re unable to prevail on some of their remaining defenses.” Stein on Monday wrote that the banks were all likely to settle rather than face trial, and put a settlement value on the four False Claims Act cases at $1.5 billion. He said an antitrust lawsuit with similar allegations filed in the Southern District of New York might reach $1 billion.  ']\n",

      "['Wall Street strategists are rejiggering their currency recommendations after the euro rose to its highest against the US dollar since March 2022.  Deutsche Bank and Nomura both say the euro has more room to run after a five-day rally, following softer-than-expected US inflation data released Wednesday that led traders to cut bets on Federal Reserve rate hikes.  George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, recommends taking a long euro position against the dollar with a target of 1.15 by year-end, according to a note Wednesday. While he said he’s been bullish on the euro throughout the year, he took profits in May, waiting “for more confirmation that dollar drivers are turning bearish.” The euro is trading at 1.11 midafternoon Wednesday. “Today’s US inflation print is the last piece of evidence we have been waiting for to recommend going long EUR/USD again,” Saravelos wrote in a noteBloomberg Terminal after the data release. Going forward, “a confirmation that the US disinflation process is underway in soft landing conditions is for us the most important macro variable for the rest of the year.” Nomura also sees strength ahead for the euro. Strategists Craig Chan, Jordan Rochester, and Yusuke Miyairi recommend a long EUR/USD trade with a target of 1.14 by the end of September, they wroteBloomberg Terminal in a note. That compares with a previous target of 1.12 by end of August. In 2021, rising energy prices boosted inflation and helped turn the Fed hawkish, which supported the dollar, they wrote. “This time, we expect the opposite to happen, i.e. low or falling energy prices, disinflationary trends and the potential for a much less hawkish Fed, with potential rate cuts next year.” The June CPI data sent a Bloomberg gauge of the dollar to its lowest level Wednesday since April 2022. The euro, boosted partly by its proximity to a booming Swiss franc, rallied 1.1% against the greenback.']\n",

      "['A big bet on a seemingly random small cap or a simple misunderstanding thanks to the complex math of options?  In the world of derivatives trading, it can be hard for Wall Street to tell the difference — a lesson likely playing out in a tiny healthcare company this week.  On Tuesday a trader, or a group of traders, purchased half a million call options on Bright Health Group, Inc., lavishing $5 million on the wager.  Such a large bet on a snoozy microcap is unusual, since options rarely trade on the company. And at first blush the price paid — between five and 10 cents each, targeting shares at $2.50 a piece — seems a no-brainer given the stock currently trades around $14. Yet a recent reverse stock split approved in May — sparking a price adjustment for options contracts — changes everything.  The maneuver gave each shareholder “the right to receive 0.0125 (New) Bright Health Group, Inc. Common Shares,” according to a memo from the Options Clearing Corporation, which provides clearing and settlement services for derivatives. The agreement also provided compensation — or cash in lieu — calculated as a fraction of BHG shares.  All this created a logistical headache. Functionally, it meant that the options price had to be adjusted. The option symbol changed to BHG1 from BHG and the cash in lieu amount was determined to be $2.26 per BHG1 contract. That puts the price of the (new) Bright Health Group, or BHG1, contract at around $0.16. In sum, the buyer(s) spent close to $5 million for the right to buy an asset if it rallies at least 1,462% to above $2.50 by the Nov. 17 expiration date.  One of two things is happening, according to Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. The trader is either incredibly bullish on the company — or simply mistaken.   In the case of the second scenario, it’s hard to know what the trader may have thought exactly. It’s possible they might have misunderstood the effective price of BHG1 to begin with — perhaps thinking that it traded close to the cash in lieu amount of $2.26. Had that been the case, a bet that the price would increase to $2.50 would not be an outlandish expectation.  Or maybe the individual thought that the underlying option traded for $16, instead of $0.16, thus assuming that they were buying a call option already very, very in-the-money. Hence, free cash.  But a no-brainer trade it is not.  “The buyer might have thought he was getting something for free, and the seller knows that they’re essentially worth much less,” Sosnick said. “When trades look too good to be true, they usually are.”']\n",

      "['Russia’s flagship Urals crude oil breached a price cap set by the Group of Seven, a blow to western sanctions efforts and arguably an economic win for Moscow. According to price reporting agency Argus Media, Urals crude topped $60 a barrel on Wednesday, climbing above the cap that the Group of Seven set last year in an attempt to restrict revenue to Moscow’s war machine. The idea of the ceiling was to stop Russian oil being transported on western ships — and with western insurance — unless it was priced under the threshold. The latest data represents a victory of sorts for Moscow, which has assembled a shadow fleet of ships big enough to transport its crude to buyers with less need for services from companies in G-7 countries, and relies heavily on hydrocarbon revenue. It’s a setback to Europe and the US, which designed the policy to keep enough oil flowing to the global economy to prevent an inflation shock — while trying to crimp profits for Russia. For some buyers of the Russian flagship crude, the breaching of the cap poses an immediate headache. This is especially true in India, a market that has sustained Russian exports but where some purchasers are still reliant on key Western services to keep imports coming. “It’s problematic,” said Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights. “Indian banks have been extra cautious in the last few months for fear of sanctions, requiring the refiners to show that the free-on-board price of their cargo was below $60 in order to put the payment through.”  There may be a knock-on effect for Moscow too, Hari added. “Russia might have to offer steeper discounts in order to keep enticing buyers in Asia,” she said. “Or the middlemen will need to take a cut on their profit margins.” The move indicates that Russia will have to rely more on its own tankers and services, or those of so-called friendly nations, according to Vivek Dhar, director of mining and energy commodities research at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Still, there will be a point at which the OPEC+ producer may struggle to replace Western provision of these tankers and services, he added. At present, it’s not clear where Russian cargoes are getting insurance from when Western insurance is being denied. Shipping experts have long warned that one of the unintended consequences of sanctions is the growing risk of environmental disaster, with no one to cover the cleanup cost. Read more: Aging Shadow Fleet Carrying Russian Oil Poses Disaster Risk “We are monitoring the market closely for potential violations of the price cap,” the US Treasury said in a statement. “It is worth noting that trades above $60 that do not use Coalition services are not in violation of the price cap and a substantial proportion of Russian oil trades, though, still use Coalition service providers.” Urals prices rose to $60.78 a barrel at the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk on Wednesday, Argus Media data show. The pricing agency’s figures are closely monitored by European Union and US policy makers and have also been used by the Russian government. In the broader oil market, prices are rising as OPEC+ cuts supplies, tightening global inventories. Russian exports are also starting to decline, putting further pressure on prices.   The price cap was always designed with a pragmatic approach. It was also meant to be revised periodically — with some EU states pushing for a tighter approach — but those reviews have quietly been shelved.  According to the State Department, Russian government oil revenues in the first five months of 2023 were down nearly 50% from a year prior. ']\n",

      "['Laurentian Bank of Canada surged the most since 1989 Wednesday after kicking off a strategic review looking into potential buyers. The Montreal-based lender, Canada’s eighth-largest by assets, jumped as much as 44% following the announcement, made after the close Tuesday. Shares pared gains later in the session, trading up about 27% as of 1:36 p.m. Toronto time. Canadian banking analysts have already begun speculating on potential suitors. National Bank of Canada said the each of the country’s six largest banks will evaluate a possible acquisition, with Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto-Dominion Bank likely the most motivated buyers. Veritas Investment Research pointed to National Bank as the top candidate. “Acquiring Laurentian Bank would increase National Bank’s share in its home market,” Veritas’s Nigel D’Souza wrote in a note to clients in which he upgraded Laurentian’s shares to “buy.” An “opportunity to add high return on equity Canadian banking assets is too good to pass up.”  Read More: Laurentian Bank Conducts Review With Potential for Sale D’Souza noted that Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal are less likely candidates with both engaged in separate takeovers. RBC is working through the acquisition of HSBC Canada, while BMO recently completed its purchase of Bank of the West. Toronto-Dominion may have a strong capital buffer after its deal for First Horizon Corp. fell through, but D’Souza noted the bank is still dealing with the fallout from the failed takeover. National Bank’s Gabriel Dechaine, who upgraded his recommendation on the stock to outperform and raised its price target to C$51, pointed to Scotiabank’s desire to gain more market share in French-speaking Quebec as a potential impetus for a deal. Dechaine estimates that owning Laurentian could give any of Canada’s largest banks a single-digit boost to their earnings per share.  Read More: Laurentian Bank Surges as Review Prompts Deal Spec: Street WrapBloomberg Terminal Not all bank analysts expect a deal to get done.  Scotiabank’s Meny Grauman, who rates Laurentian “sector perform” with a price target of C$38, wrote that the bank’s relative valuation lags peers, and the timing was off given how tough the operating environment is becoming for Canadian lenders.  Dechaine also noted that Laurentian has a weaker core deposit business than many of its larger rivals, as well as its above-average exposure to commercial real estate assets, which have struggled post-pandemic.   “We believe that the strategic rationale for acquiring Laurentian Bank is not very strong, and any deal for the bank must contend with significant political and retention risks given the regional dynamics of the country,” Grauman wrote.']\n",

      "['Billionaire Michael Hintze’s CQS is exploring options including selling part of its asset-management business, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The London-based firm is working with an adviser to gauge potential interest, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. CQS is considering a range of transactions including divesting a stake or selling one or both of its long-only and asset backed securities businesses that now make up the bulk of its more than $15 billion in assets. The firm could also spin out some of the activities, two of the people said. It’s not clear if Hintze’s flagship Directional Opportunities fund is also part of the deal talks. Deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty CQS will proceed with a deal, the people said. The firm has held talks to sell a stake in the past without anything materializing, they said.  A representative for CQS declined to comment. The move comes after a challenging few years for CQS following steep losses in some of its funds in 2020. Since then, the firm has shuttered at least two money pools, scuttled an expansion plan, spun off non-core strategies and cut jobs to return to its credit-investing roots. Assets have declined from peak of nearly $20 billion before the losses. While Hintze’s CQS is best known as a hedge fund, most of its growth has come from its lower margin long-only business. That, along with its ABS strategy, now account for a majority of its assets.  Hintze’s flagship fund, which suffered a 35% lossBloomberg Terminal in 2020, has yet to recover from the decline. The fund manages about $1.2 billion, down from about $3 billion before the losses. It gained 21.5% in 2021, 15.8% in 2022 and was flat this year through May, according to an investor document. A deal, if successful, will mark one of the most high-profile transactions in the hedge fund industry since Marshall Wace sold a stake in itself to KKR & Co. in 2015.  Hintze, a former Australian army captain, started trading Yankee bonds for Salomon Brothers in 1982, and joined Goldman Sachs Group Inc. two years later. He quit after he wasn’t made a partner. Brady Dougan, the former CEO of Credit Suisse, hired him and later gave Hintze $200 million to start his own hedge fund in 1999. Five years later, Hintze returned $500 million to Credit Suisse and took full control of CQS.']\n",

      "['Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is offering hefty tax breaks to companies to turn offices into housing, the latest example of a city seeking to address the challenges of remote work hitting downtowns and a lack of affordable residences. Wu announced a program this week to encourage conversions by taxing developers at the city’s much lower residential tax rate. The city would then offer a discount of up to 75% on the residential levy, so for a building with an assessed value of $10 million, annual property taxes would drop to as low as $26,850 from as high as $246,800. There’s no shortage of potential buildings to tap. Boston’s office market has seen its vacancy rate climb to 14.2% during the second quarter, the highest level in two decades, according to data from CBRE Group Inc. Meanwhile, the city of 650,000 is struggling with escalating housing costs. Median monthly rent for a one-bedroom has jumped 8% in just a year to $2,800, Zumper figures show.  “We must take every possible action to create more housing and more affordability so that Boston’s growth meets the needs of current and future residents,” Wu said in a statement. Boston’s Wu isn’t the only mayor trying to shore up commercial real estate in their city. In San Francisco, the poster child of cities struggling to revive from Covid, Mayor London Breed wants to use tax incentives to lure new businesses. New York’s Mayor Eric Adams has urged Wall Street to get workers back into offices and also recommended turning empty commercial buildings into homes. Boston’s program will offer a test case for the viability of office-to-housing conversions backed by tax breaks. Even with the incentive, conversions are often too expensive and complicated to make sense for developers. Many office buildings have large, dark floor-plates that are hard to divide into livable homes. The costs of such projects are also often higher than simply building a new tower from the ground up. Boston found that reducing the tax rate on residential property by up to 75% for as many as 29 years could “provide a strong incentive to encourage conversion.” The Brookings Institution said in a recent report that office-to-residential transformations are not a “panacea” and governments should be careful before rushing to fund them. Conversions often aren’t possible without significant government funding, Brookings said.  A separate study found that conversions in San Francisco, for example, can cost $472,000 to $633,000 per unit before necessary seismic upgrades.  Boston’s conversion program plans to accept applications this fall through June 2024, but it’s unclear how much the proposal will cost.     “We may get one, we may get ten, we may not get any, we won’t know what the tax impact will be until we receive the proposals,” said James Arthur Jemison, the city’s planning commissioner. “Developers and owners are saying I could convert my building or I could try to re-lease and get other tenants, and that is where another hurdle exists,” Jemison said. “As values have declined it’s become more interesting for people to make the conversion.” Boston is home to State Street Corp., Wayfair Inc. and General Electric Co. Tech firms though dominate the businesses that are looking to sublease their office space, according to CBRE. Boston’s downtown, which is home to about half of city office space, has been hit hard by the pandemic compared to other neighborhoods. An October 2022 report commissioned by the city found that economic activity downtown remained 20% to 40% below pre-pandemic levels for industries like retail. Boston, like other cities, has a financial stake in reviving the office market. The city relies on property tax revenues for about three-fourths of its general fund budget, according to S&P Global Ratings, which gives the city its AAA credit rating. Dora Lee, director of research at Belle Haven Investments, said it’s important for cities to be responsive to disruptions given the potential hit to their finances.   “These plans have been very popular but it’s not like these offices will be converted overnight,” Lee added. “This is a years-long process.”']\n",

The Port of Los Angeles saw cargo volumes rise for the fourth straight month in June as US trade patterns return to pre-pandemic patterns. The maritime gateway moved 833,035 units in June, the most since July last year, and about 70% more than in February, which was the lowest since the start of the pandemic, it said Wednesday.  Volumes at the biggest West Coast port operation are recovering after they plunged in part as US importers diverted shipments to East and Gulf facilities during labor contract talks that dragged on for more than a year.  Read More: US Supply-Chain Threat Diminishes With West Coast Port Deal Major ports like Los Angeles and other key links in global supply chains are almost fully free of pandemic congestion and the shipping disruptions caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine. While so-called normal operations are hard to pin down, comparisons to 2019 offer more clarity about the health of global trade without the shocks of the past three years. For the first half of this year, the port has handled 4.1 million units, 24% less than a year earlier. Through the first half of 2019, volume totaled 4.54 million. “Although we will likely see cargo ease in July, I’m optimistic that the second half of 2023 will show improved performance compared to the first six months,” Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka told reporters.  The dockworkers’ International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents ocean carriers and terminal operators, announced a tentative contract agreement on June 14, with the help of acting US Labor Secretary Julie Su.  “About 15% of our cargo left during these negotiations, really starting last August,” Seroka said. “History has shown that some of it will stick to those East and Gulf Coast ports. So our job now is to be absolutely relentless and going after every pound of freight possible.” The port processed 435,285 20-foot-equivalent units of imports in June, 2% less than a year earlier, while exports increased 15% to 108,072 units. Empty containers fell 14% to 289,679 units.  Seroka said the port averaged 54 million attempted cyber intrusions per month in the first half of the year.  In June alone, “we stopped more than 60 million cyber-intrusion attempts here,” he said.  Cyber threats are not uncommon to the wider maritime shipping and logistics industries. Last week, Japan’s biggest maritime port was crippled by an alleged Russian cyberattack, disrupting cargo as operators rushed to prevent a wider delay in shipments. In January, a cyberattack on a Norwegian shipping services firm ensnared about 70 companies and 1,000 ships.']\n",

      "['US Foods Holding Corp., which supplies American restaurants and hotels with everything from pastries to burgers, is seeking to expand its foodservice distribution business via acquisitions. The company aims to follow the template it set when it recently boughtBloomberg Terminal Renzi Foodservice, a distributor in upstate New York with more than $180 million in annual revenue. It was US Foods’s first acquisition in more than three years and gives it a presence in a region where it lacked a distribution center. The idea is to shorten the supply chain by expanding its distribution network.  “You can think about us doing acquisitions that fit that bill, that help us get more efficient,” Chief Executive Officer Dave Flitman said during an interview at the company’s headquarters in Rosemont, Illinois. “There’s a lot of fragmentation in the industry that I think gives us a chance to add local scale.” The company has 70 distribution hubs across the US in cities including Houston, Tampa and Las Vegas. “This industry is still very fragmented — if you look at ourselves and Sysco and Performance Food Group, we have about 40% of the market combined,” Flitman said. “There’s still a lot of opportunity to roll up the industry.” The expansion plans come as the pandemic’s impact continues to fade away. Covid-19, which forced which restaurants, schools and public venues to close their doors amid lockdowns, took a temporary bite out of US Foods’s revenue. The US dining industry, including US Foods, has rebounded, but persistent inflation is pinching shoppers’ wallets and could be stealing the momentum.  Traffic at US restaurants declined in March, April and May, according to the latest data from Black Box Intelligence. Same-store sales have been holding positive, though, driven by higher menu prices. Flitman, who took over as CEO in January, said US Foods is still holding more inventory compared with pre-pandemic levels to make sure it can meet demand from the restaurants, hotels and universities that are its clients. During Covid-19, shortages of food and packaged-goods — largely fueled by labor struggles — led to companies stockpiling supplies.  US Foods’s $1.63 billion in inventory at the end of the first quarter was up 14% from the beginning of 2020, but it was 11% lower than a year earlier. Flitman said he expects that number to drop further, noting excess inventory has to be handled “multiple times just to get the product moved to where it needs to be.” That “causes you to become extremely inefficient.” Flitman said that a shortage of truck drivers has improved, but US Foods is still trying to get enough workers at its warehouses. To attract employees and keep them happy in the jobs, which are physically demanding and often require overnight shifts, the company is starting to offer more flexibility, such as schedules of three or four days a week instead of five. He added that some of the supply-chain disruptions of the pandemic — such as suppliers failing to fill orders entirely — have lingered, likely due to labor shortages. But the trend is improving, Flitman said. ']\n",

In total, there were 10 bids to buy — and six offers to sell — grades of oil that can set the Dated Brent price benchmark published by S&P Global Commodity Insights, better known by traders as Platts. Dated underpins millions of barrels a day of oil transactions and is central to a web of derivatives tied to Brent futures, and even pivotal in setting some gas deals. Brent oil futures raced through $80 a barrel on Wednesday amid signs that Russia is honoring a pledge to limit exports, and as curbs by producers including Saudi Arabia start to tighten the market. They had been stuck either side of $75 for weeks. TotalEnergies SE was the leading bidder during what’s known as the market-on-close, an end-of-day period in which traders seek, offer and transact crudes and fuels. Trafigura Group and Mercuria Energy were also seeking cargoes, while Vitol Group and Gunvor Group were offering to sell. The bids and offers were not matched by a similarly high level of actual deals but are important in terms of determining where Platts assesses the Dated price. Platts allowed WTI Midland oil to be included when calculating Dated Brent at the start of last month, and the US grade was the most competitively priced barrel on offer, the offers show.']\n",

It pared gains to trade about 0.9% higher versus the dollar as of 3:56 p.m. in New York, still one of the best performing Latin American currencies of the day. The jump is nothing new for the currency, which is up almost 16% versus the dollar this year, trailing only the Colombian peso in emerging markets. The run — fueled by bets of a delayed easing cycle, the so-called nearshoring trend and strong remittances, among other factors — has earned it the moniker of ‘super peso.’ Earlier, data showed Mexican industrial production jumpedBloomberg Terminal more than expected in May, backing expectations that the Banco de Mexico will not be cutting interest rates anytime soon. That should continue to drive investors into the peso, said Christian Lawrence, a cross asset strategist at Rabobank.   “No one is going outright short the peso now,” Lawrence said. “We’re going to see rate cuts from Chile, from Brazil, and I just don’t think we will in Mexico.” Mexico has been the most attractive bet for carry traders, when adjusted for volatility and liquidity. Its closest peer in Latin America, the Brazilian real, has seen bigger swings tied to expectations of an aggressive easing cycle ahead, making it less appealing. The real’s carry-to-volatility ratio is now at 0.52, compared to 0.68 for the peso. “It’s about to get more attractive when you think about the potential flows from the rest of Latam,” Lawrence said.

Goldman Adds to Calls on Overvalued Mexico Peso After Rally World-Beating Currency Rally Now Faces World-Leading Rate Cuts Fast Slide of ‘Super Peso’ Highlights Test for Emerging Markets   BBVA Mexico strategist Miguel Iturribarria wrote in a note to clients that the peso had further momentum and should remain strong in the coming months, though he expected its stretched valuation to eventually favor a depreciation.  “We do not recommend shorting the peso just yet, since it is expensive because of its high carry and because we would expect a relative stable currency in the coming months,” Iturribarria wrote.  The peso has been supported by structural changes, including expectations of a flood of new investments as manufacturers move operations to the country to be close to the US market following the supply chain snags seen during Covid and deteriorating US-China trade relations. The currency has been further supported by record flows of money sent home by migrants, which is around $60 billion per year.   BNP Paribas strategist Marco Castro sees the peso slowly gaining more ground through next year, to end 2024 at 16.50 per dollar, from a current 16.88. The peso will “remain supported given our assumption of a shallow recession in the US and structural USD weakening,” Castro wrote in a July 5 note.']\n",

      "['Equitrans Midstream Corp. says its goal to complete the controversial Mountain Valley natural gas pipeline this year is in jeopardy after a federal appeals court halted the $6.6 billion project backed by West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin.  “We continue to evaluate all legal options, which include filing emergency appeals to the US Supreme Court,” Equitrans said in a statement Wednesday. “Unless these decisions are promptly reversed, they would jeopardize Mountain Valley’s ability to complete construction by year-end 2023.” The decision, backed by two orders from the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, comes despite language in recently enacted debt-ceiling legislation that was intended to prevent the pipeline from being stalled by the court, which has repeatedly ruled against the project resulting in years of delay. Among other setbacks: throwing out a permit issued by Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality and a move in January to vacate permits by the US Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The debt-ceiling language deemed the pipeline in the public interest and as long as the project sponsor adheres to its permits, it may not be litigated, said Christi Tezak, a managing director with Washington-based consulting firm ClearView Energy Partners. “It means the in-process litigation at the 4th Circuit dies,” Tezak said in an interview. “It must be dismissed.”  While this week’s rulings may prove to be the last wrenches the Fourth Circuit throws into the project, they could have a lasting impact. “It seems unlikely that the 4th Circuits’ actions would stand up to scrutiny,” Height Securities LLC said in a note to clients. “However, legal remedies such as a motion to reconsider, a motion to transfer to the DC Circuit or an emergency appeal to the US Supreme Court are typically slow ranging from weeks to more than a year.”  Operations would need to resume around mid-July for a chance at completion before the end of the 2023 construction season, Height said, adding that the court orders mean the pipeline is unlikely to meet its in-service goal “unless reversed promptly.” The roughly 300-mile pipeline is designed to cut through the Appalachian Mountains, a national forest and hundreds of stream crossings as it carries natural gas from West Virginia to southern Virginia, and has drawn fierce opposition from environmental activists.  “We’re grateful that the Court has given those communities a measure of reprieve by hitting the brakes on construction across our public lands, sparing them from further irreversible damage while this important case proceeds,” said Ben Tettlebaum, a senior staff attorney at The Wilderness Society, one of the groups challenging the pipeline.  Equitrans shares climbed 1.6% as of 12:26 p.m. in New York after falling 4.8% in Tuesday trading.']\n",

      "['The man accused by Trafigura Group of being behind a $590 million nickel fraud finally responded to the allegations, claiming that Trafigura itself “devised and proposed” the scheme. In a defense filed to a London court on Wednesday afternoon, lawyers for Prateek Gupta said Trafigura employees had proposed an arrangement whereby the two sides would agree contracts for nickel but in fact trade other material. The claim is the latest twist in a case that shocked the metals industry, when Trafigura in February revealed it had lost more than half a billion dollars buying cargoes of nickel from Gupta’s companies only to discover that they contained much lower value materials. Gupta said in the filing that Trafigura had approached him in 2019 seeking to significantly increase its nickel trading with his companies. According to Gupta’s account, during a meeting in June 2019 at a hotel on Dubai’s Palm Jumeirah, he discussed trading metals that “bore some resemblance to nickel” as if they were actually nickel with Socrates Economou, Trafigura’s then head of nickel, and Harshdeep Bhatia, a senior Trafigura trader based in Mumbai. The two Trafigura traders “stressed to Mr. Gupta that the actual purity, specification, and value of the materials in fact being traded was unimportant to Trafigura,” Gupta claims.  It’s unclear what evidence Gupta has to support the claim beyond his own recollection of the meeting.  The filing says that some of the shipping receipts showed a code used to identify the goods indicated that nickel alloy — rather than nickel — was being shipped. Trafigura in February secured a freezing order against Gupta. In its court filings at the time, the trading house acknowledged shortcomings in its own controls, including paying for cargoes despite a lack of HS code in the shipping documents, or the absence of a “certificate of analysis” verifying the contents of the cargoes.  A Trafigura spokesperson said on Wednesday the company “does not consider the defense to be credible and will vigorously continue to pursue its claim.” Both Economou and Bhatia have left Trafigura in the wake of the alleged fraud, Bloomberg has reported. Trafigura has consistently said it doesn’t believe that any of its employees was complicit.  Economou declined to comment and Bhatia didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.']\n",

Owned by former sports minister Saudi Prince Abdullah bin Musaid Al Saud, Sheffield United recently won automatic promotion to the Premier League after a second-place finish in the Championship. The club is expected to now receive a boost to broadcast income, potentially easing some of its financial concerns. It spent a significant part of last season under a player transfer ban for failing to pay installments on previously purchased players.  The deal — if successful — would mark a rare sale by a Saudi-linked owner. The country’s sovereign wealth fund has been on a spending spree in the sports industry, striking deals in golf and domestic football. The Public Investment Authority already owns a major stake in rival Newcastle United. An investor presentation from May 2023, marked as strictly confidential but seen by Bloomberg, claims that Sheffield United’s 25-man first team squad has a combined market value of £125 million.

The private equity firms are set to divest the combined 40% holding in Adnoc Oil Pipelines to Abu Dhabi’s ADQ as early as this week, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. The stake is set to fetch more than $4 billion including debt, the people said.  ADQ, chaired by influential royal family member Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is keen to make long-term investments in domestic infrastructure, some of the people said. BlackRock and KKR bought the stake in Adnoc Oil Pipelines four years ago in what was the first investment by foreign asset managers in the infrastructure of a state-owned oil producer in the Middle East.  Adnoc further reduced its stake in Adnoc Oil to around 51% later in 2019 after selling shares to Abu Dhabi Retirement Pensions & Benefits Fund and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte. Adnoc Oil has leases on 18 pipelines and the Abu Dhabi state oil firm continues to manage the pipelines, according to a statement that year.  Any agreement would add to a flurry of potential deals by Abu Dhabi. Adnoc and Austria’s OMV AG are exploring a combination of Borouge Plc and Borealis AG to create a chemicals and plastics company worth more than $30 billion, Bloomberg News reported this month. The energy group is also pursuingBloomberg Terminal a $12 billion takeover of German polymers producer Covestro AG. Representatives for Adnoc, ADQ, BlackRock and KKR declined to comment.  Adnoc, which pumps almost all the oil in OPEC member United Arab Emirates, plans to invest $150 billion to expand production capacity for crude, natural gas and chemicals. It’s also investing in low-carbon energy.  Bloomberg News reported in March that BlackRock and KKR were exploring options including bringing in new backers for their investment in the oil pipeline network.  Private equity firms continue to invest in oil and gas assets even as the world shifts toward greener forms of energy.  Last year, BlackRock Inc. assured Texas it was committed to helping clients invest in the energy industry, rebutting suggestions the firm boycotts fossil-fuel companies through its advocacy for sustainable investing. The world’s largest asset manager was also among those that in October told UK politicians they had no intention of halting the financing on new fossil-fuel supplies. KKR, meanwhile, merged its portfolio company Independence Energy with fellow explorer Contango Oil & Gas Co. in 2021 in what the groups said was a prelude to more share-oil deals. ADQ was created in 2018 and is Abu Dhabi’s newest wealth fund. It’s one of the 20 biggest sovereign funds in the world with about $157 billion of assets, according to data provider Global SWF. The firm acts as a holding company for many of the emirate’s strategic assets including Etihad Airways as well as Abu Dhabi’s airport and stock exchange operator. It has invested in top Middle East hypermarket chain Lulu Group and has become more active overseas, buying a stake in agriculture trader Louis Dreyfus Co. and making forays into Egypt. ']\n",

      "['US leveraged loans are delivering some of the best returns in the fixed-income market this year, indicating that investors think any impending downturn could be slow to come and end up being relatively mild. Total year-to-date returnsBloomberg Terminal on a key US leveraged loan index touched 7.2% this week, the highest for the period since at least 1997. Loans have outperformed other areas of credit, such as US high-yield debt, which posted total returns of 5.28%. Leveraged loans are floating rate, which means they pay more to investors as the Federal Reserve tightens rates. Performance of leveraged loans is on track to hit 10% this year if prices stay at current levels, according to Frank Ossino, senior portfolio manager at Newfleet Asset Management. Returns for the asset class last topped that figure in 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Much of this year’s performance will be driven by higher coupons, Ossino said. Lack of new issue supply will also be a positive technical throughout the summer, as slowing sales will push investors to the secondary market, driving prices higher, he said. Ultimately, a slowing economy and deteriorating corporate health will weigh on the asset class, but it’s taking longer than expected for that play out, according to Ossino. “Fundamentals are deteriorating however you measure it,” Ossino said. “But it’s happening slower than maybe some folks thought.” Read More: Risky Loans Trounce Blue-Chip Bonds as Investors Await RecessionBloomberg Terminal  While interest expenses for leveraged loan issuers have climbed 14% over the last year as of the end of the first quarter, companies have generally been able to withstand the higher costs of borrowing, according to a June report by JPMorgan Chase & Co. About 9% of loans in the market are set to mature within the next one to two years, according to UBS Group AG. Companies typically refinance their debt at least one year before maturity. Companies have been seeing a key measure of income fall relative to their interest expense, signaling they have slightly less capacity to pay their obligations. But that ratio, known as debt service coverage, is only slightly below the four-year high of 4.58 times seen in the third quarter of 2022, according to JPMorgan. “Balance sheets for most US leveraged loan issuers are in a good position heading into a more challenging fundamental landscape for corporates,” analysts including Nelson Jantzen wrote in the JPMorgan report.  Still, not everyone is bullish about the prospect for leveraged loans. For Christian Hoffmann, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, the outlook for leveraged loans is grim heading into a potential recession. “We remain extremely cautious on the loan market, owing to deteriorating fundamentals like rising defaults and poor recovery rates, as well as persistent pressure from outflows,” Hoffmann said.  The cumulative impact of the Fed’s quantitative tightening won’t just impact companies’ ability to service their debt, it will also lead to downgrades and defaults in the asset class, according to Bill Zox, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management.  “Leveraged loan outperformance is on borrowed time,” Zox said. “It’s just a matter of time until leveraged loans are faced with meaningful deterioration in credit metrics followed by rate cuts. That is the worst environment for leveraged loans.” ']\n",

Unigel declined to comment.  Unigel is poised to breach a covenant on its local bonds as high interest rates at home and lower fertilizer prices globally eroded earnings and sent its leverage ratio skyrocketing. Lending agreements — known as indentures — for the company’s local notes require it to keep the ratio of net debt to adjusted Ebitda below or at 3.5 times, and S&P Global Ratings says it could peak at near 10 times by year-end.

      "['Holders of Zambia’s $3 billion in eurobonds should suffer losses of as much as 50% in a planned restructuring deal, according to a group of campaigners in the southern African nation and London-based Debt Justice. Bondholders should provide 50% in net-present value relief on their debts, according to a report from the Zambian Civil Society Debt Alliance published Wednesday.  That’s higher than the roughly 40% NPV cut that the copper-producing nation’s bilateral lenders agreed to, and the campaigners said this is required because the commercial bonds had higher interest rates than official lenders.  The net present value assessment refers to the total value of the debt including principal, interest and repayment periods. Zambia reached a breakthrough deal with its official creditors led by China and France last month, in which they agreed to extend maturities on their loans to 2043 with rates as low as 1% for the first 14 years.  The focus has now shifted to Zambia’s commercial creditors, and the government is required to seek comparable treatment from them. Bondholders haven’t been paid since Zambia became Africa’s first pandemic-era sovereign defaulter in late 2020. The Zambian Civil Society Debt Alliance and Debt Justice report used an example in which bondholders face a 50% NPV cut and agree to a 4% coupon on new securities.  Under this hypothetical scenario, principal repayments would start in 2029 at 10% of the total, increasing in yearly increments of 5 percentage points through 2033, when they would reach 30%. This would call for a 33% haircut of principal, not including interest arrears, or 44% if they’re included, according to the report. That’s higher than what JP Morgan suggested in a recent research note. To reach comparable treatment, the bank saw a theoretical deal in which bondholders took a 30% nominal haircut and average 4.5% to 5% coupon payments, with maturity extension of 10 years.  A spokesperson for Zambia’s bondholder committee declined to comment. Part of Zambia’s deal with its bilateral creditors was that interest rates would rise and maturities reduce if the International Monetary Fund found Zambia in 2026 to have a “medium” debt carrying capacity from the current “weak” classification. To accommodate for upside contingency, a bondholders deal could include a variable rate bond with a 3% coupon, triggered to rise to 9% under the improved scenario, JP Morgan said. Amortization for that instrument could be between 2032 and 2037, it said. Bondholders would probably see the 40% NPV reduction agreed to with bilateral creditors “as a ceiling on their own losses and would probably only accept haircuts commensurate with that,” Connor Vasey, an analyst with Eurasia Group, said in reply to emailed questions.  JP Morgan’s hypothetical scenario “is feasible and likely reflects a proposal already considered by the bondholder committee,” he said. If the upside contingency clause in the deal with bilateral creditors was triggered, the amount of relief could fall to 18%, the Debt Justice report said.  The upside scenario with higher payments could be triggered by even slight changes, and the deal should be reworked to make them “contingent upon substantial economic out-performance,” Isaac Mwaipopo of the Zambian Civil Society Debt Alliance said in a statement.

      "['A month after devaluing the naira, Nigeria’s central bank is intervening in the markets to prevent sharper losses in the currency, traders say. The naira fluctuated on Wednesday before trading at 782.36 per dollar, staying within the band of 750-790 it has traded in for the past two weeks, based on Bloomberg pricing. But there had been bids for the greenback as low as 800 nairas on Tuesday before the central bank stepped in with dollar sales, according to Rand Merchant Bank. Traders also said a parallel market in the currency that had vanished after the devaluation has resurfaced. The interventions are fueling a debate on whether incoming President Bola Tinubu’s pledge to move toward a flexible interest rate meant a free float or just a one-off devaluation followed by a weaker peg. Given the inflation risks of a freer trading currency, traders are seeking further clarification from the central bank on the role of markets in setting naira’s value. Meanwhile, the demand for dollars remains strong, which may have influenced authorities’ decision to boost liquidity. “The market expects the Central Bank of Nigeria to intervene more than once this week given the size of intervention yesterday and the current demand across the market,” RMB analysts wrote in a note. The central bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Central-bank interventions are helping to avoid swings in the the naira, but the dollar sales have been too modest to say the local currency is getting pegged again, some traders said.  “The central bank has been intervening into the market over the last two weeks or so to support liquidity but this has not been very consistent,” Ayodeji Dawodu, director at UK-based BancTrust & Co. Investment Bank in London said by phone. “Trades are reportedly being conducted between 700 naira to 800 naira a dollar, which doesn’t seem to indicate controls.” The currency, which dropped about 40% over the past month, has traded around the 750 level since June 26. Deutsche Bank analysts said this week the currency may not deviate much from current levels pending further clarity on monetary policy. The longer-term outlook for the nation’s investment appeal depends on a complete elimination of currency controls, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Bloomberg Terminalsaid last month.  Tinubu’s economic plan has included the elimination of costly fuel subsidies, a leadership reshuffle at the central bank and a weaker naira — thus reversing the policies of his predecessor Muhammadu Buhari which had distorted Africa’s biggest economy for years.  Meanwhile, the parallel market saw the naira trading at 800 per dollar, reopening a gap with the official rate that had vanished after the devaluation.  “The parallel market rate has likely risen in recent days because of the still-limited liquidity in the investors and exporters window,” said Samir Gadio, head of Africa strategy at Standard Chartered Bank. Deutsche Bank strategists including Anthony Wong and Soha Rizkallah said while the naira now looks more than 20% undervalued based on the bank’s model, stronger reforms were needed for valuations to start correcting. “More measures would have to be introduced to boost investor confidence, especially with regards to capital repatriation and import restrictions,” they wrote in a note dated July 10. “We stay on the sidelines for now, pending more clarity on the monetary policy front, but are constructive in the medium term.”']\n",

      "['In politics, Donald Trump has held on to a faithful following even as his legal problems cast doubt on his future. The same goes in one risky corner of the stock market. The shares of Digital World Acquisition Corp., the special-purpose acquisition company that’s seeking to take Trump’s nascent media company public, are holding nearly 30% above the approximately $10.40 investors will get back if the merger collapses — indicating they expect the deal to go through instead. That prospect brightened last week, when Digital World saidBloomberg Terminal it struck a tentative agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to end its probe of the deal, removing one potential hurdle.  But others remain. As it stands, the takeover needs to be completed by Sept. 8 unless backers can persuade shareholders to extend the deadline for a fifth time.  Add to that: Trump Media & Technology Group said it’s only bound by the current terms until the coming deadline, according to an SEC filing, raising the possibility it could walk away. Trump Media’s main asset is Truth Social, the Twitter look-a-like that the former president uses to rally supporters.  “It remains highly unlikely that this business combination will close,” said Julian Klymochko, chief executive officer of Accelerate Financial Technologies, which has a SPAC-focused fund. “Also, if you read between the lines, it appears that Trump’s Truth Social wants out of the SPAC merger.” Digital World shares are still trading above their liquidation value, but they tumbled 86% from a March 2022 peak of $97.54 to around $13.40 as the tie up was delayed and the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes hammered speculative assets like SPACs.  In addition, the deal was held up by the SEC, which along with the Justice Department has been investigating whether Digital World ran afoul of the law by having substantive merger talks with Trump Media ahead of the SPAC’s stock-market debut.  Still, getting more time from shareholders is no sure thing. To get a three-month extension last year, its sponsors had to put another $2.9 million into the company’s cash pile, increasing the pool of funds that would be returned to shareholders. Moreover, the individual investors who snapped up the SPAC’s shares don’t vote with the predictability of professional money managers, providing another obstacle.  The tentative SEC settlement announced last week would force Digital World to pay an $18 million penalty and amend some of its previous filings to comply with the law. It’s not clear how soon that would allow for the SEC’s potential approval of the share-offering prospectus needed to close the deal, nor how it may affect the Justice Department’s investigation.  Representatives for the SPAC and Trump Media didn’t respond to requests for comment. The SEC dealBloomberg Terminal came days after three investors in the SPAC were charged with using inside information about the plans to make more than $22 million in illegal trades. Faced with the investigations, Digital World has replaced staff. In March, Patrick Orlando was removedBloomberg Terminal from his role as CEO and chairman, a step the SPAC said would help “restore confidence to the shareholders.” Its finance chief had left earlier, and only two of its original board membersBloomberg Terminal are still with the company.  This month, Digital World also named Eric Swider as the permanent CEO.  The SEC deal “removes a big impediment to completing the merger,” said Jay Ritter, professor of finance at the University of Florida. But, he added, “because of the large fraction of DWAC shares held by retail investors, in contrast to the hedge fund investors that normally own most SPAC shares, an extension is not guaranteed.”']\n",

      "['A 14-month low in the US dollar rippled through global currency markets as traders consider the impact of cooling US inflation on the Federal Reserve’s most-aggressive tightening cycle in a generation. The Swiss franc rose to the strongest level since 2015 against the US currency, while Japan’s yen climbed more than 1% on the day to consolidate its gains below 140 per dollar. The euro spiked to $1.11, and the British pound touched $1.30 — both hitting their strongest levels in more than a year. “It breathes more life into the view that the Fed is closer to the end of its cycle,” said Bipan Rai, CIBC’s global head of foreign-exchange strategy. “We can’t say that definitively for a few of the other major central banks out there, which is a powerful cue for a weaker US dollar.” Excluding food and energy, the US consumer price index — which economists view as the better indicator of underlying inflation —advanced just 4.8% from a year ago, the lowest since late 2021 but still above the Fed’s target. That sent a benchmark for the dollar slumping to the lowest since April 2022 and dragged Treasury yieldsBloomberg Terminal lower. A quarter-point hike by the Fed this month is still considered very likely, but the odds of an additional one were trimmed in wake of the data. Some 28 of the 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg were up on Wednesday after the US inflation print, with many nearing or breaching key levels.  The franc’s surge pushed it just off the highest since early 2015, when the Swiss National Bank roiled markets worldwide with an unexpected decision to abandon the currency’s cap against the euro.   The loonie also gained as the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate, pushing back the timeline for inflation’s return to target while revising growth upward. Sweden’s krona, meanwhile, was upBloomberg Terminal 3% versus the euro and about 5% against the dollar over the past four days. The Norwegian krone rallied more than 6% against the greenback over the same period as oil prices rise and expectations mount for further Norges Bank policy tightening.  Rallies extended across emerging markets, too. The offshore Chinese yuan climbed to its strongest level in three weeks Wednesday, while an MSCI Inc. index of developing-economy currencies posted its longest winning streak since May. “Disinflation is the theme now, that’s the trade,” Nomura strategist Jordan Rochester said. In terms of the Fed’s rate-hiking path ahead, “the idea of July and done is likely to gain more credibility on the Street.”']\n",

      "['The world risks losing its battle to end hunger by the end of the decade, despite signs that the crisis has stopped worsening. The lingering fallout from the pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine means about 735 million people — or 9.2% of the population — were undernourished in 2022, according to United Nations agencies. While that’s slightly less than a year earlier, it was 122 million more than in 2019 and means the world remains far off a target to eradicate hunger by the end of this decade. Access to food is being stifled by the prolonged impact of the Covid crisis on incomes and economies, as well as soaring food and energy costs that have been compounded by the war in Ukraine. The rising cost of a healthy diet and inflation also mean about 2.4 billion people were without access to nutritious, safe and sufficient food all year round, the agencies said in an annual report. “We face significant challenges and we must redouble our efforts if we’re going to end hunger,” Cindy Holleman, a senior economist at the UN’s Food & Agriculture Organization, said at a press briefing in Rome. “We need to build economic resilience, build in measures to protect the most vulnerable.” Almost 600 million people will still face hunger in 2030, 119 million more than in a scenario in which neither the pandemic nor the war in Ukraine had occurred, the report showed. That means the world is a long way off a goal to eliminate hunger by that year. Hunger was still rising in western Asia, the Caribbean and throughout Africa last year. While most undernourished people live in Asia, the continent has made progress in reducing hunger, as has Latin America, the UN agencies said.  “It’s a very unequal story,” Allison Oman Lawi, deputy director for nutrition at the World Food Programme, said at the briefing. “The poor and the dispossessed and those that are dealing with intersecting inequalities — be that pandemics or HIV or droughts or recurrent floods — are the ones that are getting the hardest hit.” The number of undernourished people globally — defined as those regularly without enough calories to lead a normal and healthy life — is a midrange of estimates between 691 million and 783 million people. The UN’s flagship State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report was jointly produced by the the FAO, the WFP, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Unicef and the World Health Organization.']\n",

Industrial output rose 1% from April, compared to the 0% forecast by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Construction grew 7.2% over the same period, while manufacturing contracted 1.4%.  In recent years, investment in Mexico has been lifted by nearshoring, which involves companies relocating some operations from Asia to be closer the US market. That’s triggered a surge in public works spending and increased demand for industrial parks and other construction projects.  Read more: ‘Nearshoring’ Push Is Fueling Tech Job Demand in Latin America  “The nearshoring wave and government investment in infrastructure significantly helped this sector,” said Andres Abadia, chief Latin America economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a phone interview. “Construction is offsetting the weakness in manufacturing.” Industrial production rose 3.9% from a year earlier, from 0.7% growth in April.  Weak demand for manufactured goods is due to the slowdown in the US economy, and this weakness is likely to continue in the second half of the year, he said. ']\n",

      "['Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said banks must be prepared for higher interest rates in case policymakers need to lift rates further to combat entrenched inflation. Managing inflation and supporting financial stability, not usually in conflict, can pose a dilemma for policymakers if banks are unprepared, Kashkari wrote in an essay released Wednesday. While the banking system is currently “sound and resilient,” stresses could emerge again, Kashkari said, as they did in March when high inflation and rapid rate increases helped trigger the failure of several regional banks. Markets currently expect inflation and interest rates to fall, in which case bank balance-sheet pressures would likely ebb, Kashkari said.  “However, if inflation proves to be more entrenched than expected, policy rates might need to go higher, which could further reduce asset prices, increasing pressure on banks,” he said. “In such a scenario, policymakers could be forced to choose between aggressively fighting inflation or supporting bank stability.”  The Fed held interest rates steady in June after raising them for 10 straight meetingsBloomberg Terminal to a range of 5% to 5.25%. Most policymakers expect to increase rates by a further half percentage point by the end of the year, according to projections released after their June gathering. Kashkari’s prepared comments followed new data out Wednesday showing the consumer price index rose 3% last month from a year ago, and core inflation advanced 4.8%, the slowest pace since late 2021. But the slowdown may not be enough to prevent additional policy tightening, with Fed officials widely expected to resume interest-rate increases later this month after pausing their rate hiking campaign in June. Read more: Fed Flags Concerns Over Credit Tightening, Financial Stress “Increasing bank resilience now could minimize the risk that if high inflation is indeed persistent, tighter monetary policy would then trigger financial stability issues going forward,” he said. Because banks are unlikely to take steps toward greater resiliency on their own, supervisors should identify those at risk and see that they prepare. There are a few steps banks can take on their own to boost resiliency, Kashkari said, including raising equity, selling assets or restricting payouts to build capital. But banks are more likely to wait it out, on the expectation that inflation falls from here and the problem goes away, he said. “Bank supervisors should use their existing authority to ensure all banks are prepared to withstand a higher-rate environment,” Kashkari wrote. Read more: Here’s the Fed’s Plan for Tighter Bank Oversight After SVB  Supervisors could ensure banks’ preparedness with high-inflation stress tests to “identify at-risk banks and size individual capital shortfalls,” Kashkari said. They could then direct those banks considered to be at risk of shortfalls to develop plans quickly, and could potentially restrict payouts. The new stress test combined with capital preservation plans would reassure the public and investors that the banks could handle a high inflation scenario, he said.  Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, who led the central bank’s internal probe of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, has said the Fed’s annual stress tests should be rejiggered to better capture dangers that banks can face.

      "['Federal Reserve officials appear poised to resume interest-rate hikes this month after data showed inflation cooled sharply in June but remains above the central bank’s target. The so-called core measure of the consumer price index — which excludes volatile food and energy prices — advanced 4.8% from a year earlier, data out Wednesday showed. That was the smallest increase since late 2021 and could give the Fed room to pause rate increases after its July meeting if the trend continues, economists say. But Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the growth in US consumer prices is still too quick even as it slowed in June, reiterating the central bank’s commitment to restoring inflation to its 2% goal.   “Inflation is too high,” Barkin said Wednesday in Arnold, Maryland. “If you back off too soon, inflation comes back strong, which then requires the Fed to do even more.” The consumer price index rose 3% in June from a year earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The report offered welcome news for policymakers who have been bearing down on price pressures. Continued relief in the core services categories — watched closely by Fed officials — could give them flexibility to pause or potentially halt rate hikes after this month, economists say.  “I definitely think that what we’re seeing today supports this slower pace of tightening,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist for EY, adding that the report showed a decline in airfare, hotel prices and housing costs. As inflation eases, that will also make real interest rates more restrictive and could lessen the need for further increases after this month, Daco said.  “In our opinion, this is the last rate hike of this cycle,” Daco said of the rate increase expected when officials gather on July 25 and 26.  The majority of Fed officials see interest rates moving higher this year to deal with a slower-than-expected cooling of price pressures and a persistently strong labor market. The Fed held policy rates steady last month, signaling a slower pace for rate moves to evaluate how the economy was responding to 10 straight increases and March’s banking turmoil.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month he wasn’t ruling out two consecutive hikes this year from the current range of 5% to 5.25%. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said separately that banks must be prepared for higher interest rates in case policymakers need to lift rates further to combat entrenched inflation. Markets currently expect inflation and interest rates to fall, in which case bank balance-sheet pressures would likely ebb, Kashkari said.  “However, if inflation proves to be more entrenched than expected, policy rates might need to go higher, which could further reduce asset prices, increasing pressure on banks,” he said in an essay published Wednesday. “In such a scenario, policymakers could be forced to choose between aggressively fighting inflation or supporting bank stability.” ']\n",

The currency gained as much as 1.5% to 0.8660 per dollar on Wednesday, reaching a level last seen in January 2015. Back then, the Swiss National Bank had just scrapped a three-year policy of capping its gains against the euro, spurring an explosive rally in the franc. The franc — both a haven and funding currency for carry trades — has been on a rally since late last year amid expectation Switzerland’s interest-rate differential to the US will continue to narrow. The SNB has raised rates by 250 basis points in the current tightening cycle to 1.75% and has sent strong signals that another hike will come at officials’ next scheduled meeting in September. “The sharp correction in developed rates after the US CPI miss raises the prospects that the terminal SNB rate may not lag as far behind as initially thought,” said Alexandre Dolci, G-10 FX strategist at Credit Agricole.  The franc is up 6.5% against the dollar and 2.7% versus the euro this year, making it the second best performing currency in the Group-of-10.  The SNB has been selling foreign currency as part of its efforts to cool inflation, which it expects to average 2.2% both this year and next, above the 2% ceiling it targets. At the last policy meeting, policymakers said they “remain willing to buy foreign currency in the event of excessive appreciation pressure on the Swiss franc,” though they noted in the current environment the focus is still on selling.  The authority declined to comment on Wednesday’s market moves. Vice President Martin Schlegel last week said additional rate increases aimed at inflation don’t threaten financial stability.  The SNB removed its cap of 1.20 franc per euro in the first days of 2015 in an attempt to reinforce its defenses of the economy.

Sura plans to double assets under management in five years at its newly re-branded investment unit, as easing policy risks and imminent interest rate cuts help spur foreign investment, said Chief Executive Officer Pablo Sprenger.  The improving macro and political climate opens the door to more investments in the region’s massive reserves of critical resources such as lithium and copper. Latin America also has a young population, strong capital markets and institutions that work well, albeit with some challenges, Sprenger said. “A black swan would need to appear to see a wave of capital flight like the one we had, and that’s nowhere near our base scenario,” he said in an interview in Santiago. To prepare for growth, Sura is reorganizing. The firm will bring its investment management and advisory services into a single regional platform called Sura Investments, headed by Sprenger.  The unit manages $18 billion now and aims to reach $40 billion by 2030. Its parent, Sura Asset Management, has 23.5 million clients with $153 billion under management.  The arrival of left-wing presidents in the past three years proposing deep reforms in sectors such as pensions, labor and taxes, saw capital fly out of the region.  Though Sprenger remains cautious with pending social demands and complex political situations, he thinks the worst is over. Governments have largely failed to implement radical reform and are now focusing more on development and security.  “For example, I see Chile much better than two years ago and much better two years ahead than it is today.”  Read More: Latin America’s Socialist Wave Sparks Historic Flight of Capital Sprenger sees opportunities in fixed income over the coming months as countries get closer to cutting rates, as well as in alternative assets such as private debt, real estate and infrastructure as borrowing costs reach more normal levels. “Alternative assets will be the main growth pivot of the asset management industry in the next 10 to 15 years,” he said.  Hanging over pension systems in Chile and Colombia are planned reforms that threaten private administrators like Sura. Sprenger said the firm would roll with any changes that eventuate.  “We have gone through many right- and left-wing governments in all countries we operate in, and capital markets continue to exist,” he said.']\n",

The two interbank rates that serve as benchmarks for interest payments on most mortgage, corporate and consumer loans dropped, according to latest data from late Tuesday. The six-month Wibor rate is down 10 basis points and its three-month equivalent has declined three basis points. Albeit the declines are minuscule in scale — especially compared with official interest rates which have been at 6.75% for nearly a year — they indicate some relief for borrowers after a period of speedy monetary tightening to help reduce Poland’s highest inflation rate this century. The moves come after Governor Adam Glapinski unexpectedly announced on Friday that the central bank may cut rates by a quarter percentage point already at its next meeting, if inflation slows into single digits. Traders in the derivatives markets are betting on at least 1 percentage point in easing over the next six months. “The guidance has solidified expectations for rate cuts,” said Piotr Bartkiewicz, an economist at Bank Pekao SA in Warsaw. “We should expect the cost of lending to decline further, giving more breathing space to borrowers.” Most Poles have variable-rate mortgages and were hit hard by a steep rise in borrowing costs, when the central bank embarked on its year-long tightening cycle between October 2021 and September last year.

It announced more than $29 billion of takeovers in the region last year, trailing only Blackstone Inc.’s $45 billion tally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

      "['One of China’s biggest state-run investors is adding to the chorus of warnings over debt risks at the nation’s cash-strapped developers and local government financing vehicles. The National Council for Social Security Fund, which oversees about $417 billion according to the latest available figures, has advised asset managers that handle its money to sell some bonds including those from riskier LGFVs and private developers after a review, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Several of them mentioned that bonds from LGFVs in Tianjin, a debt-saddled northern port city, were singled out. The recent Sino-Ocean Group Holding Ltd.’s debt rout Bloomberg Terminalraised the pension fund’s concerns as one of its biggest asset managers holds a large position in the state-backed developer’s debt, the people said. That triggered the request for a health check of their exposure to riskier LGFVs and builders, if relevant bond prices are below 95% of face value, the people added. The move underscores the difficult balancing act facing Chinese authorities as they try to defuse risks in the credit markets without destabilizing the financial system. While offloading weaker bonds may help the state pension protect the value of its investments, it risks heightening market concerns about the health of LGFVs and developers at a time when Beijing is trying to restore confidence in the world’s second-largest economy. Read more: Investors Slash Chinese LGFV Bond Tenors to Shortest On Record A representative of the state pension fund declined to comment. The institution had over 3 trillion yuan under management as of the end of 2021, according to its latest financial report. “The most important variables impacting China’s economic growth over the next two years will be the success or failure of local government debt restructuring, and Beijing’s approach to the role of local government investment within China’s economy in the future,” Rhodium Group researchers wrote in a recent report. “A collapse in local government investment would be comparable to economic impact of the crisis in the property market.” China’s anemic economic recovery and housing crisis have rekindled concerns about ballooning local government debt, including some $9 trillion of debt held by LGFVs, which are off-balance-sheet firms tasked to build infrastructure projects.  The city of Tianjin faced the biggest threat as of last year, with debt almost three times as large as its income, according to Bloomberg calculations based on available official data.  In another sign of investor wariness of the sector’s repayment risks, the average tenor of newly issued onshore LGFV bonds fell to 2.51 years in the first half of this year, the shortest since at least 1999 when Bloomberg’s data series began.  Meantime, the average coupon on LGFV yuan notes jumped to 4.39% from 3.94% last year, with that on Tianjin’s up nearly a percentage point. Showing a sense of urgency, Chinese authorities are weighing plans to support cash-strapped cities and counties by allowing additional local bond issuance to help pay down hidden debt in higher-risk areas, Bloomberg reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter. Indicating widening stress among Chinese developers, Sino-Ocean’s bonds plummetedBloomberg Terminal last week after Bloomberg News reported that a shareholder-led working group engaged a financial advisor to conduct due diligenceBloomberg Terminal and that it’s workingBloomberg Terminal with major shareholders on a plan to resolve debt risks. More broadly, a Bloomberg index of Chinese junk dollar bonds, dominated by private developers, has fallen in five out of the first seven months this year, registering a 10% loss for 2023 so far.']\n",

      "['JBS SA, the world’s largest meat supplier, is moving ahead with a long-delayed plan to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.  JBS saidBloomberg Terminal Wednesday it filed a registration request to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and will seek shareholder approval for a planned direct listing. Depositary receipts backed by JBS stock will trade on Sao Paulo’s stock exchange, where the company is currently listed. The Brazilian company, founded and controlled by the Batista family, sees the move as key to accessing a broader pool of institutional investors and building confidence in its corporate governance standards, potentially slashing its capital costs and boosting stock valuation relative to US competitors such as Tyson Foods Inc. JBS, which has a market value of $7.9 billion, has had its sights on a New York listing for more than a decade as it grew into a global juggernaut through aggressive deal making. The company now has operations stretching from Colorado to New Zealand. It’s the largest producer of beef and chicken, the second-biggest supplier of pork, and the No. 1 ready-meals company in the UK. US-based operations generated almost half of JBS’s $73 billion in revenues last year, with Brazil accounting for 12%. JBS expects its market value to more than triple to almost $30 billion, if the US listing meets the goal of closing the valuation gap to its main rival Tyson Foods Inc., the company said in a Wednesday presentationBloomberg Terminal. Previous plans to list in the US fell apart, foiled by economic downturns and a massive bribery scandal involving members of the Batista family. Chief Executive Officer Gilberto Tomazoni says the latest plan has a simpler structure compared with earlier attempts.  Read More: JBS Readies 31-Year-Old Batista for Top Job After Family Scandal “We’ve created all the conditions for this one to be approved,” he said in an interview. The plan will substantially boost the company’s ability to grow and use equity as funding, he said. “I’m convinced it will unlock tremendous value to the shareholder.” JBS plans to use a Netherlands-based entity as a vehicle for the listing. The proposed model won’t affect the way JBS operations across the world are organized, nor their financial flows, Chief Financial Officer Guilherme Cavalcanti said. The company will continue to be run from its headquarters in Sao Paulo.  “It’s exactly the same JBS as you know today,” Cavalcanti said in an interview. Shares of JBS rose as much as 9.9% in Sao Paulo, trimming their year-to-date losses. The stock is down about 16% since the beginning of the year, missing an 8% rally on Brazil’s benchmark Ibovespa equity index in the same period. The company has proposed a dual-class share structure that will give the Batistas more voting rights than other investors. Investors will have the option until 2026 to convert ordinary shares into Class B stock, which will have 10 votes each, under certain conditions.  JBS was created in the 1950s by Jose Batista Sobrinho, at time when Brazilian president Juscelino Kubitschek implemented his “50 years in five” plan to fast-track construction of the country’s new capital, Brasilia. Batista, who started out butchering five heads of cattle a day, helped supply meat for the city’s construction workers.  By the 2000s, the company had started expanding into the US through the acquisitions of Swift & Co., the beef-producing units of Smithfield Foods Inc., and chicken producer Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. The buying spree was backed by state-development bank BNDES as part of a broader government push for the internationalization of Brazilian companies. The meat producer will likely face heightened investor scrutiny for its corporate governance as well as its impact on climate change. Deforestation of the Amazon, which has been linked to grazing cattle, is a major contributor to greenhouse gases. JBS has sometimes failedBloomberg Terminal to follow through on its commitment to never buy cattle from deforested areas. It has set 2025 as a deadline to put a new tracking system in place allowing the company to better track its suppliers. Over the past few years, JBS has managed to slash its bank borrowings and boost debt maturities at a lower service cost. More recently, the company saw profits plunge amid record-high cattle costs in the US and elevated animal-feed prices at a time when inflation has curbed demand.  ']\n",

      "['The European Union’s sanctioning of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for his alleged links to President Putin was a political move by the bloc’s leaders to clamp down on a famous Russian, his lawyer told an EU court.  At a hearing in the EU’s General Court on Wednesday, Abramovich’s legal team hit out at claims that his privileged relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin allowed him to line his pockets while his company provides a “substantial source of revenue” to the Russian war effort in Ukraine. Abramovich was placed on the EU sanctions list by the EU in part due to his fame, rather than “based on evidence,” lawyer Thierry Bontinck said.  Abramovich saw his travel restricted and his EU assets frozen after he was placed on the bloc’s sanctions list in March for his alleged close links to Putin and by extension, the country’s war efforts in Ukraine. “A myth has grown up around the personality of Roman Abramovich,” Bontinck said of the high-profile former owner of Chelsea Football Club. He never had a “chance of avoiding being put under restrictive measures,” his lawyer said.   Abramovich, 56, is one of the richest people in Russia who became widely known after the sale of Sibneft oil company to state-run Gazprom for $13 billion in 2005. The billionaire was forced to sell Chelsea for £4.25 billion ($5.3 billion) after being sanctioned by the UK in March, ending nearly two decades as owner of the West London club. The EU followed with sanctions days later. As a shareholder of the steel group Evraz, one of Russia’s largest taxpayers, Abramovich is a leading Russian businessmen.  Evraz, however, has previously said that its East Metals AG unit “neither works with nor supplies goods for Russian military purposes,” nor provides financing to “anyone outside Evraz.”  Abramovich has also maintained “close and cordial” relations with President Putin, and “benefited clearly from his abnormally close relationship with Putin,” according to a lawyer for the bloc. The EU’s sanctions hit Abramovich and a tranche of other Russian billionaires and oligarchs shortly after the invasion last February, freezing his assets and restricting travel across the bloc. The former Chelsea magnate has remained in Nemchinovo, on the outskirts of Moscow, Abramovich is one among many sanctioned Russian billionaires, who have challenged sanctions against them at the EU’s highest court. Last week, a lawyer for Mikail Fridman that the oligarch’s life had been “destroyed” by the EU restrictions. While Abramovich has stopped short of explicitly condemning Russia’s war effort in Ukraine, his spokesperson last year said that the Ukrainian government attempted to solicit Abramovich’s help in “achieving a peaceful solution” amid the ongoing conflict. Abramovich had agreed to Ukraine’s request in helping to set up humanitarian corridors for those fleeing the war in Ukraine, his lawyer said. The case number is T-313/22 Abramovich v Council.']\n",

      "['Pacific Investment Management Co. has a decent record of betting on distress. Almost a decade ago, the firm managed to cope with the chaotic departure of its founder  Bill Gross because of the fortune it made from snapping up cheap mortgage debt after the financial crisis. Now, as the bond behemoth manages another awkward moment — confronted by choppy   fund flows and returns — it wants to repeat the trick. This time it wants to take advantage of finance’s latest craze: private credit. In an interview with Bloomberg News, the man in charge of Pimco’s $162 billion alternative-investment business says he’s been stepping up hiring this year as the firm beefs up its private-lending team to seize opportunities in a credit market that’s braced for carnage from stubbornly high interest rates. “As long as rates remain elevated from where deals were underwritten there’s going to be an increasing strain for some of these borrowers and structures,” says Jamie Weinstein. “The pot is on the stove and the flame is on.” The comments reinforce those of  Oliver Baete, chief executive officer of Pimco owner Allianz SE, who told Bloomberg last month of plans to   push deeper into alternative assets such as property and private credit. “We’ve added resources and headcount in the last six months to the alternatives business overall,” Weinstein says, “And particularly within corporate direct lending and asset-based lending, where we’re slowly scaling up our private strategies businesses.” The pullback in bank lending, which accelerated in 2023 after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp., is creating “meaningful opportunities,” he adds. Pimco joins a throng of asset managers flocking to private credit, drawn to higher fees and returns that can run from high single digits to the mid teens for riskier deals. The market has roughly tripled in size since 2015 to $1.5 trillion. Pimco already invests  more than $210 billion in private markets. Things could turn ugly soon, however. Private-credit funds arrange loans on a floating-rate basis, and interest-rate pressure could see some balance sheets buckle. The terms of most private-credit deals outstanding today would have been agreed at least 18 months ago when rates were close to zero. Even Pimco’s chief investment officer,  Dan Ivascyn, has warned investors to   “stay away” until the market reprices. Read More: Everyone Rushes to Private Credit Just as Risks Start to Grow Nevertheless, much like Gross and Ivascyn when they took their lucrative punt on mortgage-backed securities more than a decade ago, Weinstein and other Pimco leaders are busy positioning themselves to profit from any meltdown in private lending, real estate or other alternative assets. Pimco CEO  Manny Roman has been talking up recession opportunities since 2018, and Ivascyn is predicting a harder economic landing than most. The firm wants to be an aggressive, deep-pocketed competitor when bargains come up. “It’s about pulling the trigger at the right time when the risk is wrung out,” says Eric Jacobson, a fixed-income director at Morningstar Research Services LLC. “And they’re still waiting for that to play out.” Weinstein — who before joining Pimco in 2019 spent 14 years at KKR & Co., including running special situations investing — has been specifically fortifying his teams to manage stressed and distressed corporate assets. “Pimco needs to find assets which need active fund management and offer higher margins,” says Charles Graham, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “That’s the attraction of building a private-credit platform.” The firm will lean on its huge client base to tap all areas of this once niche market, including straightforward direct loans to private equity companies, corporates and real-estate firms as banks and capital markets back away from the scene. But the riskier funding of assets in trouble will be crucial. Pimco has assembled a cohort of restructuring experts to try to get an edge over less well-resourced rivals. Many direct lenders who set up a business making loans on corporate buyouts “haven’t built teams that include workout people for if these things go wrong,” Weinstein says. “We’ve been built for it the whole time.” As Pimco doubles down on alternatives, it’s been actively hiring “operational specialists” to manage the distressed debt of companies it has stakes in — evidence of how it plans to assert control when businesses are struggling. “It goes far beyond a workout strategy in a distressed position,” Weinstein adds. “It’s where we’re directly involved in a company. We’ve built that muscle for Pimco in the last year.” Rivals can already attest to Pimco’s assertiveness in stressed situations, including its involvement in so-called “creditor-on-creditor violenceBloomberg Terminal.” Last year it threw a financial lifeline to a struggling aerospace supplier, but in the process pushed other creditors down the pecking order for repayment. Separately, Pimco is trying to capitalize on depressed prices in bond and loan markets. Last year it bought billions of euros of buyout debt that banks couldn’t sell, adding them to its flagship $124 billion bond fund. Scooping up this “hung debt” is a trade usually associated with hedge funds and private equity firms taking heftier risks. In recent months Pimco has kept buyingBloomberg Terminal. Read More: Pimco Puts $2 Billion Into Assets Depressed by Recession Fears It has also backstopped deals to businesses that need cash to survive, including those where Pimco’s already on the hook. It was part of a group of funds that provided extra financing to Adler Group SA to give the beleaguered German landlord time to sell assets and repay creditors. Pimco’s alternatives push is backed by the numbers. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates the unit generated about a fifth of group revenue in 2022 even though it only makes up about 5% of investments at what’s still overwhelmingly a bond firm with $1.8 trillion of assets under management. The broader business has been through a torrid time after a long bull market for bonds ended abruptly, although things have improved lately. A €75 billion streak of outflows ended last quarter as the asset manager drew €14 billion of new money. Its biggest bond fund — the flagship Pimco Income Fund — has returned 3.6% this year in the institutional share class, beating 92% of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pimco’s bosses hope the recent gains stick. The return potential in bonds is the best it’s been in 14 years, they said in a Bloomberg TV interview last month. Ivascyn has been touting safer assets such as agency mortgage-backed securities, which have a government guarantee. He’s also pitched short-term publicly traded bonds that provide equity-like returns, drawing  a wry response from Gross who’d made the same call a few weeks prior. While Ivascyn sticks to traditional strategies, Weinstein is in the thick of the hunt for distressed wagers. Morningstar’s Jacobson sees the parallels between Pimco’s big crisis-era mortgage bet and Weinstein’s prep work this year: “Ivascyn stepped in when the assets were ultra-cheap and capitalized on wider fear still plaguing the market. It could be a similar game they play this time around with their alternatives business.” As the alternatives arm seeks ways to bolster the firm’s profit margins, it’s also touting private lending to commercial and residential real-estate firms, as well as mortgage-backed securities. Pimco’s looking at private mortgage pools in the US and some European markets. It foresees a tsunami of property loans maturing through 2025, including at least $1.5 trillion in the U.S., about €650 billion in Europe and $177 billion in Asia-Pacific. “It’s pretty hot on that stove right now,” Weinstein concludes.']\n",

      "['Local plumbers and lumber-yard owners across the US are feeling a bit like tech entrepreneurs of late — juggling multiple offers from private equity-backed firms that increasingly are targeting mom-and-pop businesses.  Wall Street has been buying into fragmented Main Street industries for years, with dental and veterinary practices among the favorite targets. It’s known as the roll-up strategy – and it’s catching a tailwind right now, and expanding rapidly in household services and building materials.  Small firms account for the biggest share of acquisitions by PE funds and their portfolio companies since the late 2000s, according to data from industry analyst PitchBook. They made up more than 61% of all private equity deals in the first quarter of 2023, compared with an average in the mid-50s over the past decade or so.  “If you acquire enough, you get economies of scale,” says Tim Clarke, PitchBook’s lead private equity analyst. “You just keep rolling rolling, rolling and before you know it you’ve got 10-20% of the market.” One reason that approach is popular now, according to Clarke, is that higher interest rates have pushed valuations down across the board. Owners who might otherwise have considered a sale — whether they’re publicly traded companies, or private equity — are holding onto companies in their portfolios instead. As a result, would-be buyers are turning toward smaller privately-owned firms, which also tend to be cheaper relative to their earnings.  What’s more, private equity’s enthusiasm for small firms is spreading into industries like plumbing and other trades — which have shown they’re recession-proof, even in the Covid slump, and have room for consolidation because markets are typically divided up among many businesses. All of this Wall Street interest is a blessing for some Main Street owners looking to cash out. They don’t all see it that way, though.  In the Atlanta area, Jay Cunningham says he gets several pitches a week from PE-backed firms wanting to buy his Superior Plumbing — one of the few sizeable local firms that hasn’t already been snapped up by investors — or from investment bankers wanting to bring Superior to market. He’s not interested. “I probably think they’re a nuisance as a whole,” Cunningham says. In terms of dollar value, PE acquisitions of publicly traded companies or those bought from other private equity firms still make up the biggest chunk of deals. Even by that measure, though, purchases of founder-owned businesses — which in most cases are valued at under $100 million apiece — are on the rise. They accounted for more than 43% of deal value in the first quarter of 2023, well above the typical levels in recent years, according to PitchBook. Especially prized are firms with steady revenue, subscription models and electronic billing, says John Wagner, a New Mexico-based investment banker who helps small and midsize companies find buyers. Better yet, he says,  is a locally owned firm with strong revenue but high expenses — an opportunity to cut costs, increase efficiency and quickly boost the firm’s value. In the Denver area, Steve Swinney is constantly hunting for lumber yards, steel fabricators, drywall distributors and kitchen-interior companies. His Kodiak Building Partners started out buying one steel fabrication firm 12 years ago, in the wake of the Great Recession. It’s made about 40 acquisitions since then, and welded them all into a building-materials firm with sales of around $3 billion.  As it looks for more mom-and-pop firms to buy, Kodiak — which is majority owned by New York-based PE firm Court Square Capital Management — faces plenty of competition.  “There’s definitely a lot of other players out there,” Swinney says. “I wish we were alone.” John Loud gets as many as 30 solicitations a month for his Kennesaw, Georgia-based alarm installation firm, Loud Security Systems, which has about 60 employees and more than $7 million in annual revenue.  “It’s a non-stop barrage,” Loud says, and it’s been going on for years. He used to joke with employees: “If you want job security, save me from these calls and these emails.”  Nowadays, though, Loud is entertaining offers. His two kids aren’t interested in running the family business, and at 56 he feels closer to the end of his career than the start.  He expects to continue with the firm after any sale, and keep 30% equity in the company, but figures his proceeds will be enough that if things don’t work out, “I’ll never have to go create a new business, never have to go to work.” His longtime friend Cunningham, the Atlanta-area plumber, is comfortable for now holding onto Superior Plumbing, which has about 60 employees and $10 million to $15 million in annual revenue.  A couple years ago, the 61-year-old Cunningham says, he sent a rudimentary financial brief to an investment firm and the would-buyer shot back an offer for more than $60 million. But unlike many peers, his children are interested in taking over the firm at some point.  “Right now I have five kids in my business. That’s a combined north of 60 years of time,” Cunningham says. “If I sold for $60 million, it wouldn’t enrich my life at all.”']\n",

      "['Further interest-rate increases by the European Central Bank would add to the dangers for the euro-area economy as it seeks to exit a recession, Portugal’s finance minister cautioned. Inflation is already on a downward trend following an unprecedented bout of monetary tightening by the ECB, Fernando Medina said in an interview. Meanwhile, the effects of rate hikes to date haven’t yet been fully absorbed by households and companies. “The risks that further increases could create a more difficult situation for growth at the European level are now higher and should be looked at very carefully,” Medina said this week in Lisbon. Warnings about the consequences of additional tightening are growing louder as the ECB nears the end of a campaign that began a year ago and has brought its deposit rate to 3.5% from below zero. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said last month that officials in Frankfurt haven’t properly grasped the nature of the inflation that the euro area is facing, while his Italian counterpart, Giorgia Meloni, has said “constantly increasing rates” risks turning into “a cure that does more harm than good.” Bank of Portugal Raises 2023 Economic Growth Forecast on TourismBloomberg Terminal ECB’s Centeno Sees Inflation Slowing With Core Prices to Follow ECB’s Nagel Sees Hard Landing Avoided Though Growth May Slow Output in the 20-nation bloc shrank between October and March after prices surged and policymakers moved aggressively to rein them in. In Portugal, where inflation has eased to 4.7% from its euro-era record late last year, consumers are being squeezed by the prevalence of ever-rising variable interest rates on mortgages and loans. Despite that, Portugal’s post-pandemic economy is outperforming much of Europe with employment remaining very strong, according to Medina. This year’s 1.8% growth forecast — published in April — may be surpassed, he said. The central bank, for one, predicts 2023 expansion of 2.7%, driven by tourism. That may counter grumbling among some about low wages and Portugal being overtaken by eastern European Union members like the Czech Republic and Slovenia in terms of gross domestic product per capita. “We’re converging, we’re improving our position inside the euro zone,” Medina said. “We’re facing a structural change in the Portuguese economy, in the good direction.” That transformation includes lowering what’s currently the euro area’s third-highest debt ratio, behind Greece and Italy. This year’s figure will be below 107% — beating the 107.5% target set in April, according to Medina. “We’ll most probably end 2023 with a burden of debt on GDP that’s lower than Spain, France and probably Belgium,” he said. Portugal’s 10-year bond yield was at 3.4% on Wednesday, up from 3.1% six months ago but still lower than the rate for Italy or Spain. It peaked at 18% in 2012 at the height of Europe’s debt crisis.']\n",

The company plans to launch a “retail electricity product in the UK” as part of Tesla Electric, which currently sells power to consumers in select markets such as Texas. The company plans to register with the UK industry regulator as a household electricity provider, according to a job advertisement on its website. Tesla’s entrance to the market would follow the collapse of a swathe of suppliers as the energy crisis squeezed the ability of small firms to pass on costs. About 30 UK-based firms went bust after they were unable to manage their trading strategy when prices shot up in summer 2021. The listing, for a UK head of operations at Tesla Electric, seeks applicants that are “comfortable with ambiguity” and have “a healthy skepticism of the status quo.” The role is based in London and Manchester. As well as electric cars, Tesla produces the Powerwall — a home battery that stores solar energy. The company partnered with Octopus Energy Ltd. in 2020 to offer an electricity tariff that allowed British homeowners to create, store and return solar power to the grid. Tesla’s new business will “support the transition of the entire electricity grid to 100% renewables,” the listing says. Adam Bell, previously head of energy strategy at the UK’s former Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, questioned whether Tesla’s service would comply with the universal service obligation. “If you are retailer in the UK, you have to offer everyone a tariff,” he said. “You can’t just do business with a select group of people who have a Powerwall.” Bell suggested Tesla avoid the retail market by aggregating Powerwall output and selling it to the grid. “There’s already a rich market, and it’s a far more efficient way of using the assets they have,” he said. “They might want to build up a consumer profile by doing this, but if I wanted to make money that’s what I would do.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.']\n",

In a sector whose boom days of investor exuberance turned startups into billion dollar enterprises in a matter of weeks, a divide is emerging. Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. are beating the gains in the S&P 500 Index this year, while once-prominent and much-hyped EV startups like Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc., Workhorse Group Inc., Nikola Corp. and Canoo Inc. have seen double-digit declines.  “We are likely to see execution and profitability become the more dominant factors in EV production going forward,” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management said in an interview. “The new players in this market will need to demonstrate a clear path to profitability, and job number one will be to ramp up a consistent level of units produced and sold.” Rivian, whose recent record nine-day rally added $11 billion to the company’s market value, has taken the biggest strides in that direction.

Rivian shares were up as much as 2.6% in New York on Wednesday, while Lucid fell 5.5% off the disappointing deliveries. Both are still comfortably higher for the year. On the flip side, many early entrants that were once investor darlings have met with hurdles that for some have been unsurmountable. Lordstown Motors Corp. — which was once hailed by former US President Donald Trump for saving automaking jobs, and which commanded an equity value of $5 billion in early 2021 — filed for bankruptcy last month, after a deal with Foxconn Technology Group collapsed. Workhorse scrapped its flagship electric delivery van, and in 2022 delivered just 33 units of W4 CC — a cab chassis.  Nikola — whose market capitalization once eclipsed that of Ford Motor Co. — has struggled to keep its stock price above the Nasdaq’s minimum requirements in order to stay listed.  Overall, it is quite the turn of events since the boom days of 2020-2021, when many of these EV stocks rose to prominence, riding on the coattails of a stratospheric rally in industry stalwart Tesla Inc.’s shares. However, after 2022’s market-wide selloff and worries about high inflation, an economic slowdown and tightening central bank policy, investors are more wary about speculative growth stocks.  “We are seeing a lot more discipline in tech investing in general,” Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer at SPEAR Invest, said in an interview. Yet, Delevska noted that the setup for EV stocks has improved lately, as auto sales are holding up. Indeed, EVs carry a lot of lure for investors as the industry is on the cusp of big changes. According to estimates from Bloomberg New Energy Finance, EVs will represent 75%Bloomberg Terminal of all global passenger car sales by 2040, up from 14% in 2022.  At the same time, the emergence of companies focusing on other parts of the EV ecosystem — such as battery-makers, battery-metal miners, chipmakers and charging-station operators — have provided investors the opportunity to participate in the EV trend without paying a steep premium or taking on too much risk. It has made the yet unproven EV-makers look even more unattractive.  “It is a good alternative to investing directly in ‘start up’ manufacturers,” Zacks’ Mulberry said, as despite their own sets of risks, the “road to strong cash flows and profitability is a much shorter one.”  Activision Blizzard Inc. shares jumped 10% to $90.99 on Tuesday, narrowing the gap with Microsoft Corp.’s $95-a-share offer after a US judge gave the deal a green light. Investors are clearly more encouraged about the deal’s prospects of closing after the court’s ruling, which also prompted UK regulators to pause their litigation over the proposed $69 billion takeover. Activision was down as much as 1.3% Wednesday.']\n",

      "['In the race to win control for debt-laden supermarket operator Casino Guichard-Perrachon, the two bidders are working to charm creditors, the company and the government after laying out their initial plans.  The groups — 3F, formed by banker Matthieu Pigasse, telecom billionaire Xavier Niel and retail entrepreneur Moez-Alexandre Zouari, and a rival composed of Czech investor Daniel Kretinsky and Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière’s Fimalac — have until Friday to improve their bids. Kretinsky and Fimalac are trying to get enough backing from secured creditors, as their offer involves a bigger conversion of that type of debt into equity and less participation in the new money than their rival’s proposal, according to people familiar with the matter. It’s still being discussed whether that could involve swapping less debt into equity, bigger participation from creditors in the equity injection or a mix of both. Meanwhile, 3F is looking into ways to improve what has been the main criticism of their financial proposal: that their offer of new equity is too small, other people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named discussing private information. The business plan proposals differ on three main points: how to get people back into the group’s stores; the size of expansion for the franchise network — with Kretinsky-Fimalac more conservative, while 3F’s proposal is bigger but still less than the company’s suggestion for nearly 3,000 stores and focused on the regions where Casino is already strong; and who is going to lead the task. 3F is counting on Zouari’s experience —including as a Casino franchisee — while the rival bid has lined up former Lactalis and Metro executive Philippe Palazzi for the chief executive officer role, relying on current management at Franprix.  A spokesperson for Kretinsky declined to comment, while a representative for 3F didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Casino said it has asked for revised offers by 9 p.m. CET on Friday, and that they’ll be assessed based partly on “the unconditional nature of the equity commitments” and “the level of liquidity available to the group following completion of the restructuring.”  Casino added that estimated second-quarter hypermarket sales are down 17% on a like-for-like basis, mainly due to price cuts. Sales at Cdiscount stores are expected to be down 22% like-for-like. The group now expects full-year French post-lease earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to be below €300 million ($334 million), down from €440 million in a business plan presented June 26, it said in a statement. The rival bids are the end game in Casino’s long-running collapse under a mountain of debt. The company has been seeking since 2018 to cut borrowing via asset sales, but its concentration in areas heavily reliant on tourism backfired during the pandemic and a strategy to raise prices more than its competitors added to Casino’s woes more recently. With the company struggling to generate enough cash, Casino in May entered into court-supervised talks with creditors and other stakeholders — including the French state — to restructure its balance sheet. The proposals would involve new equity investments from the two bidders and others and the conversion of a significant chunk of the company’s debt into equity. Read more: Billionaires Lay Out Rival Plans to Rescue Troubled Casino Under the restructuring, existing shareholders would be left with almost nothing and Casino’s chairman and chief executive officer, Jean-Charles Naouri, would lose his controlling stake. Nonetheless, Casino shares soared as much as 12% Wednesday after Les Echos reported that the bidders would improve their proposals. In the meantime, the French grocer is pursuing a business plan designed around its smaller, premium supermarkets in city centers in Paris and Lyon and on the Cote d’Azur. Even though it’s keeping its cash-burning hypermarket operations in France, the group is planning to sell assets such as its business in Latin America.  Adding to the liquidity pressures, the company is getting reduced financingBloomberg Terminal from suppliers, ratings firm Moody’s said this week. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Tuesday in ParliamentBloomberg Terminal that both offers to recapitalize Casino were solid and that it’s not the state’s role to choose between them.

      "['British banks can’t be held responsible for fraudulent transactions if the customers themselves had authorized the payment from their account, the UK’s top court has ruled, limiting the prospect of lawsuits by scam victims. Barclays Plc, the bank facing a compensation claim over a payment fraud in the case, was in fact duty bound to carry out the customer’s instructions to make the payments, the Supreme Court ruled. Placing a duty on the bank to stop payments expressly authorized by the customer “is inconsistent with the first principles of banking law,” the judges said in the verdict. Barclays can, however, still face a trial in the case on whether it was in breach of its duty to act promptly to try to recall the fraudulent payments made in the case after the fraud came to light. The verdict comes just a month after the UK’s Payment Systems Regulator brought new rules requiring banks and payment companies to reimburse victims of so-called authorized push payment, or APP frauds. The bank and firms sending and receiving payments would equally share the liability and provide additional protections for vulnerable customers, according to the new regime to curb frauds. Barclays’ duty is one that requires the bank to make inquiries to ensure that it doesn’t make a payment which the customer has not authorized, the Supreme Court said. Barclays welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision, which gives “certainty and clarity on an important issue of law and public importance,” a spokesperson for the bank said in a statement. The verdict is a relief for lenders in the keenly-watched case as a loss for Barclays could have exposed banks to a flurry of lawsuits from fraud victims. Authorized push payment frauds, where customers are tricked into making a payment, are estimated to cost victims about £500 million ($647 million) annually, according to the payment regulator. The amount is, however, a fraction of the £2.6 trillion fast payments transactions processed annually, the regulator said in its cost-benefit analysis.  “This judgment will be viewed by many as a victory for common sense,” said Sue Millar, a partner at law firm Stephenson Harwood. “The idea that banks had a duty to second-guess the motivation behind a customer’s payment request was, in reality, totally unworkable” and significantly reduces the scope of a bank’s liability, she added.  The dispute in the case arose after a music teacher and her husband were deceived into sending £700,000 from their Barclays savings account to the UAE bank accounts of a fraudster in 2018. The money, which was a bulk of the couple’s live savings, had gone by the time the fraud was discovered. At the commercial court in Bristol the bank succeeded in striking out the case. The judge rejected the victims’ argument that the bank breached its duty to put in measures to detect and prevent such a fraud and reverse the transaction. The Court of Appeal overturned that ruling leaving Barclays to appeal to the Supreme Court. “Anyone celebrating today’s ruling may be overlooking the recent changes to reimbursement rules, which essentially require banks to reimburse consumers’ money lost through APP fraud,” said Mike LaCorte, chief executive officer at Conflict International, a private intelligence and security agency. With the growing threats of more sophisticated frauds,“banks now need to redouble their efforts to educate consumers on the signs of fraud,” LaCorte said.']\n",

      "['Chinese diesel exports have surged as local demand for the workhorse fuel drops and refiners take advantage of a shift in processing spreads that makes exports profitable. In the first 11 days of July, shipments averaged more than 300,000 barrels a day, according to Vortexa Ltd., a data analytics firm. That’s a faster daily clip than registered in the previous four full months. The pickup in overseas sales from the largest crude importer comes during a seasonal drop in local demand over summer, although it may also be due to China’s lackluster recovery. The increase in flows is also likely to boost competition and potentially hurt the margins of refiners in other parts of Asia. At present, processors in southern China make almost 280 yuan ($39) a ton more by exporting diesel to Singapore than selling it domestically, according to an estimate by industry consultant OilChem. That’s highest since the start of the year and compares with losses over most of the second quarter. Refiners in China ship their products overseas under a nationwide quota system, with allocations issued in stages to processors by product. This month, state refiners are set to raise runsBloomberg Terminal to 10 million barrels a day, the highest rate this year, after seasonal maintenance came to an end. “China certainly has the capacity to ramp up diesel exports later this year,” said Zameer Yusof, senior oil analyst at Kpler, although he cautioned that the actual level depends how much additional quota firms receive. The data analytics firms’ latest supply-and-demand projection is for a monthly diesel surplus of around 750,000 to 800,000 barrels a day for the rest of the year, he said. ']\n",

The city recorded just HK$2.7 billion ($345 million) of deals in the period, Colliers International Group Inc. said in a report on Wednesday. The weak performance was largely due to a lack of transactions in office and industrial properties, according to Thomas Chak, co-head of capital markets & investment services at Colliers. “Investors are expected to remain prudent in the coming months, affected by the sluggish mainland Chinese economy and anticipated further rate hike by the US Federal Reserve in the second half,” Chak said.

But high interest rates have deterred investors in recent months as the rental yield struggles to keep up with borrowing costs, according to Chak.

      "['A struggling Italian football club has won a reprieve on its state-backed loans in an unusual deal that’s designed to avoid taxpayer losses.  Unione Calcio Sampdoria SpA will have at least an extra decade to repay about €50 million ($55 million) in loans granted under a government aid program during the pandemic. The club, which was relegated to Italy’s second division in June, is in the process of trying to shore up its finances to sell itself.  It marks one of the first restructurings by a large company that tapped Italy’s generous loan program that was set up during Covid lockdowns and may be seen as a template for other firms that run into trouble. Earlier this month, SACE backed a pre-insolvency proposal for builder Cimolai SpA that included an impairment on guaranteed loans. Sampdoria reached a deal with SACE SpA, a credit insurance agency that’s owned by Italy’s economy and finance ministry, and banks that granted the loans as part of a broader debt restructuring, according to people familiar with the matter. The new deadline has been set at 2043, said the people, asking not to be identified because the talks are private.   Sampdoria confirmed it had reached an agreement with SACE and its creditors in a press release on Wednesday.   While creditors don’t usually allow so much extra time, in the case of SACE, it means that they don’t have to record any formal losses from the sports club.  The state-backed loans are part of a broader €175 million debt overhaul at Sampdoria. Creditors will take a haircut on the other borrowings, which include money the club owes to banks, suppliers and players’ agents. SACE had guaranteed loans from banks including Macquarie Group Ltd and Banca Sistema SpA.  A representative for Macquarie declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News, while spokespeople for SACE and Banca Sistema didn’t respond.  The approval of the loan extension is seen as key to the sale of the Genoa-based club. In late May, investors including Andrea Radrizzani, the former controlling shareholder of the English club Leeds United, and Gestio Capital made a €40 million offer for Sampdoria conditional on a debt restructuring. Sampdoria was formed in 1946 by a merger of two clubs and has roots in Italian football that stretch back to the 1890s. While it thrived in the 1990s, winning top-flight Serie A competition and European Cup Winners’ Cup, its finances have suffered in recent years.  The debt restructuring still has to be formally signed off by a Genoa court. The club was granted protection from its creditors until early October, according to a legal filing seen by Bloomberg. As part of the SACE agreement, the club will promote initiatives that support local youth and disadvantaged groups, Sampdoria said in the press release.  Italy had €114.3 billion of outstanding state-guaranteed loans as of December 2022, the most of any European Union member state, according to data from the European Banking Authority. ']\n",

Benchmark futures slumped as much as 9.8%, extending this week’s decline. Works at the giant Troll field in Norway have been extended again — for the fourth time this month — but it’s still expected back at full capacity by Friday, promising higher supply to the market.  Meanwhile, demand for gas remains soft. While hot weather is blanketing parts of Europe and raising cooling needs, overall gas usage — in all consuming sectors — is below historic averages after companies and households cut consumption last year.  Coupled with Europe’s higher-than-usual inventories, which are now 80% full, that helps keep a lid on gas prices and adds to a sense of security for the continent as it prepares for next winter.  Still, traders continue to monitor possible updates from Norway on maintenance schedules to see if another major facility, the Nyhamna gas-processing plant, will be back online after delays later this week. A local unit of Shell Plc is preparing for the plant’s start-up on July 15, the company’s spokeswoman said by email.

      "['Europe’s largest initial public offering of 2023 gave investors and Romania something to cheer about, with the shares surging in their debut in what may be a turning point for the market in Bucharest.  Shares in Romanian utility Hidroelectrica SA advanced as much as 11% in their debut in Bucharest. The renewable power producer immediately became Romania’s biggest listed company, worth more than $10 billion, and the ticket for the local bourse to ditch its frontierBloomberg Terminal status and graduate to an emerging market at MSCI.   The $1.8 billion offering, completed last week, was oversubscribed as the company’s high profitability and dividends lured investors to the owner of hydropower stations, including on the Danube river. The listing of a minority stake in Romania’s biggest producer of electricity also fulfills one of the criteria needed for the European Union member nation to gain access to more aid from the bloc. “I see this as a turning point for Romania,” said Pablo Escondrillas, Managing Director and Head of EMEA Power Investment Banking at Citigroup Inc. “This IPO will hopefully allow to attract more investors.” Citi was a custodian and stabilization manager in Hidroelectrica’s listing. Hidroelectrica shares closed at 110 lei, up 5.8% on Wednesday, compared with the IPO price of 104 lei.  Europe’s largest IPO since Porsche AG and the third biggest in the world this year is a test for the Bucharest Stock Exchange, which has one of the lowest liquidity pools of any markets in eastern Europe. The bourse’s average daily turnover amounted to the equivalent of $23 million this year, according to its data, while Hidroelectrica’s traded volume singlehandedly topped $171 million on Wednesday. Hidroelectrica is trading under the H20 ticker and will have the fourth-largest weighting in Romania’s BET Index. It replaces aluminum smelter Alro SA in the benchmark gauge.  “The tale has just begun and we want to turn it into a success story for Hidroelectrica and the capital market,” Bucharest Stock Exchange Chief Executive Officer Adrian Tanase told a packed room celebrating the listing, with guests including Prime Minister Ion-Marcel Ciolacu, central bank Governor Mugur Isarescu as well as company executives.  Isarescu said the stock exchange passed its “maturity test” with the listing, including the IPO in which retail investors bought 20% of the offered shares. The benchmark BET index jumped as much as 3% on Wednesday, trading at the highest level since February 2022. In order to get upgraded to emerging-market status at MSCI, the Bucharest bourse should allow local pension funds to become more active players on the market and increase the number of companies with high turnover and free-float, according to Attila Gyurcsik, the CEO of Accorde Fund Management in Budapest. “It would be important to have other large public companies listed on the stock exchange,” said Gyurcsik, whose fund bought shares in the IPO. “Even if state ownership in companies already listed on the stock exchange were reduced,” it would help make the index “as diversified as possible,” he added. Hidroelectrica attracted buyers also because as a renewable energy producer, it “fits well in different portfolios,” said Alexandru Ilisie, Investment Director at OTP Asset Management Romania, which also bought shares in the offering. “In terms of the cons, we see the highest risk from the regulators capping energy prices lower than today, or from higher windfall taxes,” he said. “We hope that the company will diversify its investments into other green energy solutions.”  Fondul Proprietatea SA, an investment vehicle managed by Franklin Templeton, sold a 17.3% stake in the utility during the IPO, reducing its holdings from nearly 20%. The remainder of Fondul’s stake in Hidroelectrica might be used to help support the trading price if required, according to a filing.  Proceeds from the sale of Fondul’s stake will be distributed to its shareholders, which include pension funds, in the coming months. The IPO has triggered an “avalanche” of interest in the Romanian stock market, with “thousands” of new accounts set up, giving investors new exposure to Bucharest-listed companies and the country’s economy, bourse Chairman Radu Hanga said. Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG, Erste Group Bank AG, Jefferies GmbH and Morgan Stanley Europe SE were joint global coordinators in the deal. Banca Comerciala Romana S.A., Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, BofA Securities Europe SA, UBS Europe SE, UniCredit Bank AG and Wood & Company Financial Services, a.s. were joint bookrunners.

      "['Russia’s flagship Urals crude oil rose to the cusp of a price cap that Group of Seven nations imposed in an effort to cut the Kremlin’s funding for the war in Ukraine.  If the country’s top export grade surpasses the $60 threshold, it would allow Moscow to claim a win of sorts by showing Russia can get its barrels to buyers around the world without help from western firms. The price cap allows Russian oil to be transported with western ships and insurance only if it’s priced below the threshold. But a vast shadow fleet of tankers has emerged since sanctions ratcheted up last year, helping to haul the nation’s oil and work around the cap. “The significant expansion of the shadow fleet of tankers and alternatives to western insurers and payment routes provide alternatives that will likely allow Russian crude cargoes to continue moving,” said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd.  If all Urals cargoes were to avoid western vessels and services, it could create some pressure on the capacity of the shadow fleet, push up freight premiums, and cause more vessels to switch into Russia’s service, he said. The grade rose to $59.98 a barrel at the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk on Tuesday, according to data from Argus Media. The pricing agency’s assessments are important in determining future caps. US officials have long argued that the price cap is there to give buyers leverage while ensuring that, if Russia can’t transport its own barrels, there is no consequent oil supply shock. But a breaching of $60 for Urals would nonetheless suggest Russia’s ability to get its barrels delivered independently is growing. Prices for oil that’s similar to Urals have rallied around the world because those are the main type of supply that members of the OPEC+ alliance have been withholding from the market to prop up prices. Russia’s own oil flows are showing signs of falling, in line with a pledge the nation made to cut exports. Headline Brent futures rose as high as $80.55 a barrel on Wednesday. Urals at the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk also gained, rallying to $59.38, the Argus data show.  ']\n",

      "['China’s financial regulator asked banks to respond to a bearish research report on the sector by analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., underscoring heightened sensitivity in Beijing toward negative market commentary as the economy slows. The National Administration of Financial Regulation communicated with several of the largest Chinese banks after Goldman analysts cut ratings on some shares and lowered price targets on others, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named discussing private information. The regulator told banks to respond appropriately, without giving specific guidance, the people said. The NAFR didn’t respond to a Bloomberg request for comment. Neither did representatives of Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., both of which were downgraded by Goldman to sell. China Merchants Bank Co. addressed the Goldman report in a clarification statement dated Friday, saying it had “misled some investors” and was “illogical.” The bank’s rebuke followed a similar rebuttal in the state-run Securities Times newspaper last week. One of China’s largest macro hedge funds has also criticized the report. The unusually public backlash to Goldman’s research has put a spotlight on official efforts to counter negative investor sentiment toward markets and the economy. A prominent finance writer and two of his peers were suspended from a social media platform for spreading “negative and harmful information” about stocks in late June, a move that raised fresh questions about access to independent information in the world’s second-largest economy.  Secret World of China Market Research Emerges From Xi Crackdowns Why It’s So Hard for China to Shake Uninvestable Tag: QuickTake In its report published on July 4, Goldman analysts led by Shuo Yang, a former official at the China banking regulator, highlighted risks of lenders’ exposure to local government debt. Potential losses could weaken earnings growth, hurt capital accumulation and thus affect dividend payout levels, the analysts said.  This isn’t the first time Wall Street research has proved controversial in China. The last high-profile saga involved an “uninvestable” call on Chinese Internet firms by JPMorgan Chase & Co. last year, which eventually cost the brokerage a senior underwriter role in a stock listing. The incident underscored the tricky path global banks have to navigate as they ramped up their businesses in China, while still giving clients access to candid research on the country’s turbulent markets. Goldman’s report landed at a time when investor concerns are mounting over the health of China’s debt-laden local government financing vehicles. Worries that banks may incur losses from these LGFV debts started spiraling after some state-owned lenders began to offer extra credit support to the vehicles.  Chinese bank shares had already taken a beating, with a Bloomberg Intelligence index of lenders tumbling 14% as of Tuesday from this year’s high in May and wiping out $78 billion in market capitalization. Under pressure from China’s monetary easing and tepid loan demand, banks are facing renewed challenges after authorities asked them to extend debt relief to help the struggling property sector.   China Merchants Bank, which saw target prices trimmed by Goldman twice in less than three months, argued that the report is “illogical” in the way it calculated the potential losses, “lacks basic common sense,” and overestimated its exposure to the LGFVs.  Chinese macro fund Shanghai Banxia Investment Management Center dismissed the note on Monday, saying the US bank’s prediction that local government debts would sink Chinese banks’ profits and push up their bad loans will likely be proven wrong. The state-backed Securities Times last week urged the market not to take a bearish view on Chinese banks based on “pessimistic assumptions” which are “misinterpretations” of the facts.']\n",

      "['The value of Democratic Republic of Congo’s currency continues to slide as security and pre-election spending, coupled with lower-than-expected revenues, put pressure on the exchange rate with the dollar.  The Congolese franc has lost more than 20% of its value against the US currency since the beginning of the year, dropping from about 2,000 francs to more than 2,400 last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Recent central bank interventions including an interest rate hike and increased franc reserve requirements for commercial banks have failed to stop the depreciation. On the streets of Kinshasa on Tuesday, some money changers offered 2,550 francs per dollar. Congo’s economy grew 8.9% last year, according to the International Monetary Fund. The Washington DC-based lender forecasts a strong 6.8% increase in 2023, buoyed by expansion in mining, particularly copper. But the government’s revenue projections look to be overly optimistic, according to the IMF.  “The government’s revenue shortfalls and rapid spending contributed to a deterioration of the external balance, excess domestic currency liquidity, exchange rate depreciation, and persistent inflation,” the IMF said in a review of its loan program with Congo published last week. Spending in the lead-up to elections scheduled for December and government expenditures on a series of violent conflicts in eastern Congo, as well as speculation by money changers are all contributing to the franc’s slide, five bankers interviewed by Bloomberg over the past three weeks said. “If you look at the near-term outlook on the DRC, I don’t see how this will stop,” Willy Mulamba, the president of Congo’s banking association said by phone Friday.  Government spending on salaries for employees, military and internal debt has flooded the market with francs, according to Mulamba. But most transactions above $100 are done in dollars, so people often change their money immediately, he said. More than 80% of bank deposits are in dollars, he said.  “We’re receiving increasing pressure from our clients because we are not able to provide enough dollars so they can meet their obligations,” Mulamba said.  Congo’s poorest, who use the franc for small purchases, bear the brunt of the depreciation. As the franc’s value falls the cost of food staples is rising. Prices for food and fuel are already higher due to widespread inflation around the globe. Consumer prices rose 21% in the twelve months through June 24 in Congo, according to the central bank website.  Malangu Kabedi Mbuyi, the central bank governor, urged Congo’s council of ministers on Friday to work with the bank to coordinate monetary and budget policies to reduce the exchange rate and inflationary pressures. Kabedi Mbuyi also reminded currency traders of recent central bank rules prohibiting the publication of the exchange rate in public along the street, in an attempt to ward off an erosion of confidence in the franc. In the first quarter of 2023 the central bank sold $100 million of its reserves, which, coupled with tax payments by Congo’s copper miners, slowed the franc’s slide slightly, according to the bankers and the IMF.  In May the central bank eliminated a 2020 rule prohibiting commercial banks from charging more than a 2.5% margin above the official exchange rate. This helped reduce the spread between the official rate and the parallel market, which had grown to 14% in March, according to the IMF. Last month the central bank increasedBloomberg Terminal its benchmark interest rate to 11% from 9% and ordered commercial lenders to keep 10% of franc deposits in reserves as francs, up from 0%.  The reserve requirement should mop up about 300 billion francs ($130 million) of “structural excess liquidity,” according to a plan by the government and central bank published by the IMF last week. If that doesn’t work, the central bank is ready to further raise franc reserve requirements for banks and increase its key rate, according to the plan.  But that won’t do much if the government doesn’t control spending in the lead up to December’s elections, the five bankers said, declining to be identified for fear of upsetting the authorities. Mulamba said Congo’s banking association was confident the government would step in to prevent the population from losing too much purchasing power during an election year. “I think that this would be a key point where the government will have to do something,” he said.']\n",

      "['Romania’s stock market is gearing up for a swarm of new investors and record liquidity as the country’s largest electricity producer begins trading in Bucharest. Hidroelectrica SA will kick off its bourse career on July 12 with a market value of roughly $10 billion. That’s after investment vehicle Fondul Proprietatea SA last week raised 8.1 billion lei ($1.8 billion) from the sale of a 17.3% stake in the utility. Retail investors took up a fifth of the shares on offer.  The oversubscribed initial public offering — Europe’s largest of the year — is a test for the Bucharest Stock Exchange, which has one of the lowest liquidity pools of any market in eastern Europe. Renewables producer Hidroelectrica is 80% owned by the Romanian state, which must be held for at least a year. The Bucharest bourse will extend its premarket order period from 15 minutes to one hour on Wednesday to ensure Hidroelectrica’s debut goes smoothly. Normal trading will open as usual at 10:00 a.m. local time. Hidroelectrica will trade under the H20 ticker and have the fourth-largest weighting in Romania’s BET Index. It replaces aluminum smelter Alro SA in the benchmark index. In an interview last week, Bucharest Stock Exchange Chief Executive Officer Adrian Tanase said he expected a surge in liquidity from the nation’s largest-ever listing, also predicting all-time high trading orders and volumes on the day. Erste Group Bank AG is acting as stabilization agent on behalf of stabilization manager Citigroup Inc. It may use the remainder of Fondul’s stake — which was about 20% — in Hidroelectrica to help support the trading price if required, according to a filing. Bucharest Stock Exchange said trading in Hidroelectrica will take place in accordance with its volatility interruptions mechanism. Some fund managers are forecasting gains on Hidroelectrica’s reference price of 104 lei a share. “I expect share prices to rise on the first day if there’s no huge drop in sentiment, given especially the retail over-subscription,” said Eszter Lokietek, fund manager at OTP Fund Management. Attila Gyurcsik, Hungary-based CEO of Accorde Fund Management, who bought into the IPO, said last week that he expected it to “be worth buying more of the shares” in Hidroelectrica since pricing was attractive. Proceeds from the sale of Fondul’s stake in Hidroelectrica will be distributed to its shareholders, which include pension funds, in the coming months. Fondul’s net asset value will decrease after the Hidroelectrica deal and it plans to start asking shareholders for flexibility to start making new investments to boost its NAV, Bloomberg reported previously.']\n",

The strike, which began July 1, has blocked the flow of goods through major maritime hubs on the Pacific coast, including at the Port of Vancouver and Port of Prince Rupert. The disruption has already hampered the exports of commodities and inbound shipments of manufacturing materials, while fertilizer giant Nutrien Ltd. is curtailing production at a potash mine. “After 11 days of a work stoppage, I have decided that the difference between the employer’s and the union’s positions is not sufficient to justify a continued work stoppage,” O’Regan said in a Twitter post. A deal is within reach and he has asked the senior federal mediator to send a written proposal of settlement terms within 24 hours, he said. Once the minister receives the terms of settlement, he’ll forward them to the International Longshore & Warehouse Union and the British Columbia Maritime Employers Association, which will then have 24 hours to decide whether to recommend that deal to their members.  Separately, the Canadian Labour Congress sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, urging his government to allow the sides to finish bargaining and warning that legislation to force ILWU members back to work would be met with “strong resistance from the entire labor movement.”  Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters, a lobby group, has estimated the strike is disrupting C$500 million ($379 million) of trade per day, but the effects of extended port shutdown would ripple worldwide. Canada is the world’s largest producer of potash, and British Columbia is entering a key season for food exports. A survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business published on Tuesday found that about half of business owners said the strike would affect their operations.

      "['Australian central bank Governor Philip Lowe said the rate-setting board will move to eight meetings a year from 11 now, beginning in 2024, while reiterating that policy may need to be tightened further. Four of the Reserve Bank’s meetings will be on the first Tuesday of February, May, August and November, Lowe said in a speech in Brisbane on Wednesday. The exact dates for the other four will be published “soon,” he added. Decisions will be announced at 2.30 p.m. Sydney time as is the case currently. Among other changes decided by the board at its July meeting: The revamp follows an independent review of the RBA earlier this year that recommended wholesale changes to the central bank’s board structure and decision-making processes. “Together, these changes are significant,” Lowe said. “The less frequent and longer meetings will provide more time for the board to examine issues in detail and to have deeper discussions on monetary policy strategy, alternative policy options and risks, as well as on communication.” The measures come after Treasurer Jim Chalmers said earlier Wednesday that he expects to make an announcement “soon” on whether Lowe will receive an extension or be replaced. The governor’s seven-year term expires in mid-September. Asked after the speech about his future, Lowe stuck to the formula he has used whenever the subject of reappointment has been raised. “If I was asked to continue in the role, I would be honored to do that,” he said. “If I am not asked to continue in the role, I will do my best to support my successor.” Lowe spoke a week after the RBA board left the cash rate unchanged at 4.1%, just its second pause in a 15-month tightening cycle, and signaled further hikes “may be required.” He reiterated that position in the address and expanded on it when asked whether he’s become more confident on the inflation outlook. “Consumption growth is weak and that is largely because of what is going on with monetary policy,” he said. “We’re confident what we’re doing is working. The question is how much more we need to do and we have a completely open mind on that.” The RBA is assessing the impact of 4 percentage points of tightening since May 2022 and the governor highlighted today it was conscious of the lags involved in rate hikes flowing through the economy. “Lowe’s speech was softer on the inflation and interest rate outlook, with a less explicit tightening bias,” said Diana Mousina, deputy chief economist at AMP Capital Markets. “I wasn’t expecting the changes to the number of meetings to be announced so soon and it does seem to be lining up with a change of leadership in the RBA.” The governor said the board will conduct a full review of its central forecasts and risks at its next meeting on Aug. 1 and assess “the many cross-currents affecting the inflation outlook.” “On the one hand, there are ongoing pricing pressures from several factors,” he said, referring to high capacity utilization, strong growth in unit labor costs, rapid housing rent rises and higher electricity prices. “But, on the other hand, there are several factors working in the other direction, contributing to the easing of inflation.” “So, it is a complex picture and there are significant uncertainties regarding the outlook,” he said.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect two more RBA rate hikes to 4.6% this year while market pricing implies at least one more increase in October.  Returning to the changes, Lowe said other recommendations will be considered after the legislative process has been completed and the new Monetary Policy Board is up and running. “This will avoid the current board locking the new board into a particular approach,” he said.  These include: Lowe highlighted that the current as well as new monetary policy boards recommended by the review are “unusual” by international standards given only two of nine board members are insiders. Faraz Syed, an economist at Citigroup Inc., said Wednesday’s speech was the governor’s last chance for a “public audition” for an extension. “We believe it’s unlikely that Governor Lowe gets an extension, and the more likely outcome is a replacement from outside the RBA, one which gives the government more confidence to execute the sweeping institutional and cultural changes recommended by the RBA Review.”']\n",

In April, Australia agreed to temporarily suspend a WTO case against China over the barley tariffs for a three-month period, with a possible fourth month if needed. China has now requested the extension, according to a spokesperson for Foreign Minister Penny Wong.  If the duties are not lifted at the end of the four-month period, Australia will resume the dispute in the WTO, the spokesperson said.

Australia’s Nine newspapers reported Tuesday that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was considering postponing his trip to Beijing until 2024, with the government not wanting to stage such a significant visit until all China’s trade sanctions on Australian goods were lifted. Beijing imposed tariffs of over 80% on Australian barley in May 2020, after accusing the country of dumping the grain in China. At the time it was estimated the penalties could cost the Australian market as much as A$2.5 billion ($1.7 billion) over five years, according to industry group Grain Growers. In 2018-19, the barley trade with China was worth almost A$1 billion. Australia expects to follow a similar process to remove trade barriers for wine, if agreement is reached on barley.']\n",

The market value of Mitsui Fudosan Co. reached 2.63 trillion yen ($18.7 billion) on Tuesday, giving the Tokyo-based firm a solid lead as the most valuable real estate developer in Japan over its competitor Mitsubishi Estate Co., which for decades was the island nation’s top property company.  Mitsui Fudosan’s lead has been boosted by its portfolio of shopping malls, leisure facilities and hotels that have benefited from a rebound in tourism, analysts said. Among its sizable hotel holdings, Mitsui has a major stake in the operating company for the luxury Imperial Hotel. It also owns baseball stadium Tokyo Dome. “These are segments that fell during the pandemic. Now they’re recovering, and Mitsui has a higher weight in these leisure and shopping sectors than Mitsubishi,” said Kouki Ozawa, a senior analyst at SBI Securities Co. “Mitsui has more growth potential now.”  Mitsubishi Estate, which bought the Rockefeller Center during Japan’s asset-inflated bubble economy in the 1980s, had been the country’s most valuable listed real estate company for years partly due to its ownership of a cluster of office buildings in Tokyo’s prime business district by the Imperial Palace.  But a glut of new office supply, with a slew of buildings opening in the capital over the next two years, might pressure the value of holdings of top-grade office space, analysts said.  Tokyo’s vacancy rate for offices in its main business areas rose to a nine-month high of 6.48% in June, while rents have fallen every month since August 2020, according to real estate broker Miki Shoji Co. Globally, investors are also shying away from offices due to historically high vacancy rates in major cities.  Lower Tokyo Office Vacancies Give Relief to Market After Covid A representative for Mitsubishi Estate declined to comment. A Mitsui Fudosan spokesperson said revenue from many of its commercial properties had risen above 2019 levels.  Mitsui’s market capitalization was 361.6 billion yen higher than Mitsubishi on Tuesday. The gap between the value of the two companies has widened since January — shortly after Japan began loosening Covid-era border restrictions on tourism — to the highest levels since data compiled by Bloomberg was available in 1992.']\n",

      "['Even in a year where currency volatility is falling worldwide, the slump in swings in the Indian rupee has traders from London to Singapore asking when the central bank will loosen its iron grip. The rupee’s one-month implied volatility versus the dollar crashed to its lowest since 2005 in June, drawing queries from investors on roadshows of Citigroup Inc. and ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. to gauge the path ahead for the Indian currency. That’s largely because of the outsized role of the Reserve Bank of India in keeping the rupee in a tight range.  The RBI has added back $32 billion in reserves already this year as it absorbed foreign inflows to keep the currency steady, while its dollar forward book also climbed by around $10 billion in the first four months of the year. The central bank’s efforts for a stable rupee may be aimed at boosting its appeal as an international trade currency, according to Citigroup. “Fixed-income investors are basically looking for ways to trade the Goldilocks environment in India and the clearest way for those that believe dollar can weaken also is to go long the rupee,” said Abhishek Upadhyay, economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership, who is back from a recent client trip to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. “Traders clearly want higher vols, even as investors are still willing to wait longer for RBI to let go of rupee.”  The rupee’s historical volatility is the lowest in Asia over the past year, barring the pegged Hong Kong dollar. It has coincided with a global decline in assets volatility. The JPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index is at 8.2%, down from this year’s high of 11.6% seen in March. The rupee’s gains have been muted this year despite over $12 billion of inflows into the nation’s stocks, while its high-yielding rival Indonesia is up about 3% with only a small fraction of those inflows. RBI has maintained that it intervenes to keep undue rupee volatility in check. The currency was trading up 0.1% at 82.30 per dollar on Wednesday. Investors from M&G Investments Inc. to T. Rowe Price Group Inc. are largely positive on the rupee driven by improved macros and the world’s fastest-growing major economy. “India’s balance of payment has moved back into surplusBloomberg Terminal,” said Guan Yi Low, head of fixed income, Asia Pacific at M&G. “India is also benefiting from the relocation of global supply chains. We see upward potential for India’s growth outlook in the coming years, and are positive for the rupee.” The rupee stability has analysts and investors discussing the RBI’s currency strategy, and its pros and cons.   “RBI may be ascribing the same weight to currency stability as it does to price stability and financial stability in an uncertain global environment,” Samiran Chakraborty, India economist at Citigroup, wrote in a note. Yet, the dangers of lower volatility can’t be overstated. Historically, long periods of unusual stability in the rupee have been followed by a sharp depreciation as periods of tranquility can lead to complacency, according to Citigroup. “The negative side effects of low volatility are often insufficient hedging by corporates which can lead to unwanted currency exposure in case of a sharp downward move in the rupee,” said Rajeev De Mello, global macro portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management in Geneva. “Foreign investors adjust their positions based on volatility and could increase their rupee positions excessively.”']\n",

      "['Even London’s wealthiest homebuyers are shying away from deals as a cocktail of pricier borrowing and political uncertainty spooks the city’s real estate market. Transaction volumes across prime London — which includes the capital’s most affluent postcodes — dropped about 20% in the first half of 2023 compared to last year, according to data compiled by researcher LonRes. Deals priced at £5 million ($6.5 million) or more tumbled the most, as wealthy homebuyers wait for signals on whether the next UK government will shake up housing policy. “We are hearing anecdotal reports of buyers expressing nervousness around the political situation and expectations of a change in government,” said Nick Gregori, head of research at LonRes. “Combined with the economic outlook and forecasts of price falls, it is no surprise that some people are in no rush to buy this year.” Millions of UK homes have declined in value this year on the back of a triple whammy of pricey borrowing, economic uncertainty and the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. The average two-year and five-year fixed-rate mortgages have both surged above 6% this summer, with the former hitting its highest level since 2008 this week. Meanwhile, as the clock ticks down toward a general election due by January 2025, the opposition Labour Party’s double-digit polling lead may concern some wealthier homebuyers. Lisa Nandy, Labour’s spokeswoman for housing policies, said in May that the party was considering reserving some sales in new developments to first-time buyers and banning overseas residents — who make up a significant deal of prime London sales — from purchasing more than 50% of properties in a project. The share of new homes sold in advance of completion in London — a type of deal popular with foreign buyers — dropped to 44% last year, tumbling from a peak of 71% in 2016, according to broker Hamptons International. At the same time, the proportion of investors purchasing homes across England and Wales dived to 21% from 70% in 2015, when a buying spree was underway before the introduction of a stamp duty surcharge on second homes in 2016 damped demand. Still, the number of prime London properties going under offer in June — billed as a leading sales indicator by LonRes — was 6.3% higher than the same month in 2022, signalling a potential uptick in deals later this year. What’s more, the number of price reductions registered in the first half of 2023 is almost double the amount recorded in the same period last year, suggesting a motivation among some vendors to sell in anticipationBloomberg Terminal of a significant house price decline. However, properties took 100 days to go from under offer to exchanging hands between April and June, the report said, compared with 82 days in the same quarter of 2021. That’s as the number of withdrawn home offers grew 8% year-on-year to 493 in June, while the amount of deals falling through also climbed 4% in the same period. “Buyers are still out there and they are keeping the market moving and underpinning values – at least for now,” LonRes’s Gregori said. However, “it’s difficult to ignore the turmoil in the mortgage market, which is set against an uncertain economic backdrop.”']\n",

      "['Money-market funds are getting their biggest rules overhaul in years after Wall Street’s top regulator finalized a plan to stem rapid outflows during times of financial stress. The US Securities and Exchange Commission decided Wednesday to require fees that could significantly affect a key corner the $5.5 trillion industry. Although the regulations will make it more expensive to yank money during tumult, the regulator backed off a “swing pricing” proposal that the industry opposed. The new rules are meant to discourage runs like the one in March 2020 and shield remaining shareholders from costs tied to the high level of redemptions. After the pandemic’s onset roiled markets, the Federal Reserve was forced to step in to rescue money-market funds for the second time in 12 years, leading to calls for the SEC to impose tougher regulations.  Under the regulations approved by three of the commission’s five members, some funds will face mandatory liquidity fees. Those will kick in after a one-year implementation period for institutional prime and institutional tax-exempt funds when daily redemptions surpass 5% of net assets. “I believe that liquidity fees, compared with swing pricing, offer many of the same benefits and fewer of the operational burdens,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said. The changes will make money-market funds more resilient, he added. Read more: Money-Market Funds Brace for Biggest Regulatory Revamp in Years The liquidity-fee approach that the SEC decided to impose would require fund managers to charge redeeming investors to discourage a rush to be first to exit the fund during times of market volatility. Mass redemptions can increase costs to a fund and dilute remaining shareholders’ assets. Swing pricing, essentially a cost imposed on investors redeeming shares in money-market funds, differs in that it would adjust — or swing — the price above or below a fund’s net asset value per share, in the event flows in or out of a fund are determined to be too large. An SEC proposal in December 2021 would have made the swing-pricing measure mandatory, specifically for institutional prime and institutional tax-exempt money-market funds. The reprieve marks a significant victory for JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s asset management unit, State Street Corp. and Federated Hermes Inc., which had opposed the measure. Among the complaints were that swing pricing would drive up investor costs and lead to a large decrease in institutional money-market funds’ assets. Still, the SEC’s decision to back off didn’t satisfy critics.  The shift to a liquidity fee as an alternative to swing pricing isn’t likely to get “a full-throated endorsement” by money-market funds, Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce said during a meeting to consider the plan on Wednesday.  That sentiment was swiftly echoed by some in industry, including Investment Company Institute Chief Executive Officer Eric Pan, who said by email that the SEC “has missed the mark” by forcing some funds to adopt costly and complex fees. ICI is a trade group representing money-market funds. “There’s an amount of relief that the vote has happened but there’s a new challenge with liquidity fees,” said Jeff Weaver, a senior portfolio manager and head of global liquidity solutions at Allspring Global Investments, which has more than $530 billion assets under management. “We need to wrap our arms around that.” Peirce, one of two Republicans on the SEC, also said firms would benefit from additional time to get ready for the changes.   William Birdthistle, who leads the SEC’s investment management division, said that the implementation period was sufficient. Money-market funds can take advantage of their experience with the existing liquidity-fee framework, which is less onerous than swing pricing, he said. The other point of contention for the industry was forcing government funds to convert to a floating net asset value in the event of a negative interest-rate environment. Under the final rule, these vehicles can choose how to maintain a stable net asset value per share. They can either convert to a floating share price, or reduce the number of shares outstanding.  Some funds will also see their minimum daily and weekly liquid asset requirements rise to 25% and 50%, respectively, from the current levels of 10% and 30%. “This will provide a more substantial buffer in the event of rapid redemptions,” Gensler said.  The SEC said that the industry will have a transition period to comply.  Separately, the commission proposed requiring large brokerages to calculate the net cash owed to customers and other firms on a daily rather than weekly basis. According to Gensler, the plan would make it less likely that customers lose money if a broker fails. The SEC says that many big firms already do daily calculations. Unlike the money-market fund rules which are now final, the agency must take public feedback on the brokerage calculation plan and vote again to put it in place.']\n",

      "['Traders betting the Bank of Canada will raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday are already scanning the horizon for signs the economy will slump and drag down the nation’s currency with it.  Foreign-exchange strategists, including those at Macquarie and Nomura International, are predicting a roughly 4% decline for the loonie by year end from current levels. A volatile housing market and competition for foreign investment with its closest neighbor, the US, are among the forces likely to tip the currency lower.  The Canadian dollar has been able to eke out a more than 2% advance against the greenback in the first half of 2023. In contrast, a slowdown in Toronto’s housing market after the central bank’s surprise rate hike in June and a May consumer price reading which rose by the smallest amount since 2021 could help cap future BOC increases and in turn the loonie.  “Our bearish view for the second half 2023 remains predicated on the prospect that Canada will suffer a more severe slowdown than the US,” said Thierry Wizman, global currencies and interest rate strategist at Macquarie Futures USA.  The impact of Canada’s rate increases, particularly within the housing market, are likely to come with a lag, he added. “The rise in rates has already happened and households will begin to feel the squeeze as fixed-rate mortgages are rolled over at higher rates,” Wizman said. “Until now, this effect has been delayed as banks try to extend durations on new mortgages to lighten the payment burden for households that are overly indebted. But this has its limits.” He expects the loonie to fall to 1.38 per dollar by year end, a view echoed by the Royal Bank of Canada. The Canadian currency traded around 1.32 per greenback on Wednesday, nearly 1% off of its June highs. Nomura International’s 1.37 target is similar. “US economic resilience will ultimately adversely affect CAD,” strategists Jordan Rochester and Yusuke Miyairi wrote in a recent note. “The latest inflation print is unlikely to encourage the BOC to rush and deliver an additional hike in July,” they said. Key to the currency’s outlook is the rate differential between US and Canada, typically a solid guide to the loonie’s value. Should US growth outpace that in Canada, it is likely Fed rates will stay higher for longer relative to the BOC’s.  Economists are widely expectingBloomberg Terminal Canada’s rate to rise by another 25 basis points on Wednesday before being capped at 5% when Governor Tiff Macklem ends his tightening campaign. Meanwhile, swaps traders have priced in 16 basis points of rate increases at the meeting, with the odds of a hike rising to just shy of two in three. On Monday, a trio of Federal Reserve officials said that higher rates will be needed to reach the central bank’s 2% inflation target. A report Wednesday, however, showing price levels eased more than estimated in June sent Treasury yields down sharply as traders priced in lower expectations of Fed hikes later this year. There are also signs the Canadian economy still has steam. Labor market data released Friday came in triple the estimates of economists, with the economy adding roughly 60,000 jobs even as wage growth moderated. While Canada’s April GDP reading came in flat, lower than projected, the economy is expected to have grown by 0.4% in May. Economist expectations of a recession, meanwhile, in Canada have been continuously pushed back as the nation proves more immune to higher rates.']\n",

      "['Canada’s banking regulator is proposing to make it more costly for lenders to accommodate mortgage borrowers who stretch out their loans in an effort to limit housing-market risks in the financial system. Lenders would have to hold more capital against mortgages that are in “negative amortization” — that is, in which the monthly payments are no longer enough to cover the interest owed, and so the balance is getting bigger. The new rules would apply to mortgages where the loan amount is 65% or more of the value of the property, according to a proposalBloomberg Terminal released Tuesday by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.  The move is the latest attempt by regulators to contain fallout from the Bank of Canada’s interest rate hikes over the last year.  Canada’s pool of variable rate mortgages, which track the central bank’s overnight rate, have come in for particular scrutiny. The products became very popular when rates were at record lows during the early part of the Covid pandemic. But when the central bank raised rates sharply last year, some borrowers took the option of not paying the full amount of interest they owe each month.  This unpaid interest is tacked onto the principal instead, a process called negative amortization because as the loan grows, the lender extends the total time for it to be repaid.  The regulator’s proposal for higher capital requirements would provide one more curb on how the banks use this tool, and “encourage banks to lessen the number of mortgages that would otherwise go into negative amortization,” OSFI said in its proposal. It will be open for comment until Sept. 1. The change to the bank’s capital requirements wouldn’t cause borrowers’ monthly payments to increase during their current term, the statement said.

All told, the story in the world’s biggest bond market in recent sessions has been a painful unwinding of wagers that the spread between front- and long-end rates will flatten or invert anew.

Investors have been reevaluating their positioning and curve trades before Wednesday’s key inflation data and the Fed’s policy gathering next month — two events that could add fresh fuel to the recent steepening of the yield curve.

On the week, asset managers also flipped net long SOFR contracts, adding $3.9 million per-basis-point to net positioning.  Hedge funds added the equivalent of about 77,000 10-year contracts to their short — increasing the positioning divergence with asset managers.

      "['The Bank of Korea is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Thursday, standing pat for the fourth straight meeting as economic risks linger. All 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep its seven-day repurchase rate at 3.5%, where it’s been since January. With a decision to hold seen largely baked in, analysts will focus on whether policymakers continue to flag the possibility of a future hike as an option or signal they are nearing a policy pivot. The swaps market is currently pricing in steady rates for the next three months, with slmost one full increase in the next six. The yield on the nation’s policy-sensitive three-year bond has risen more than 40 basis points since the end of March to 3.7%, back above the key rate and indicating earlier bets on rate cuts have mostly receded.  “There is no reason for the BOK to hike at the moment with inflation coming under control and the won stabilizing,” according to Huh Jeong-In, an analyst at Daol Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. Still, the central bank may retain a hawkish tone to allow room to maneuver in case central banks including the Federal Reserve continue to raise rates, she said. Governor Rhee Chang-yong has so far stuck with a tightening bias despite signs that consumer inflation is moderating. Rhee has maintained that the board intends to deliver one more rate increase if inflation proves sticky. But complicating that stance are persistent risks to economic growth. South Korea posted its first trade surplus in 16 months in June, with overall shipments falling the least since October. Still, chip exports and shipments to China — the country’s most important industry and its biggest trading partner — both extended declines. Purchasing managers’ data show overall manufacturing activity has been declining for the past 12 months. Adding to risks for the economy are lingering concerns over another potential credit crunch as default rates at MG Community Credit Cooperatives increase. Market jitters related to the MGCCC are likely to be manageable, as the government contendsBloomberg Terminal, “but one can’t help being uneasy,” Daol Investment’s Huh said. On the consumer prices front, the headline inflation rate eased for a fifth month in June, but gains by the core price gauge, which excludes oil and agricultural prices, have proven stickier than expected. Both headline and core inflation remain above the BOK’s 2% target. Korea’s record-low rate gapBloomberg Terminal with the US has stirred central bank concerns over capital outflows. The Federal Reserve is expected to increase rates by a further half percentage point by the end of 2023, according to projections released after the FOMC met in June.  Rhee’s remarks will be the focus Thursday, as he is expected to reveal whether the central bank’s decision was unanimous and unveil his version of the Fed’s “dot plot” during a press briefing following the decision. In May, Rhee said the hold decision was unanimous, while six of seven board members were still open to the terminal rate reaching 3.75%. “While we expect a unanimous decision from the policy board to hold, more focus is likely to be placed on whether one or two members reduce their terminal-rate forecast for the next few months,” Son Bum Ki, an emerging Asia economist at Barclays PLC, said in a note. “We believe all board members will keep the door open for one more hike, as it would be hard for the BOK to give any signs of dovish messaging yet.”  “How more Fed hikes would affect the economy and the won will likely be a big topic of discussion. Korea’s policy rate is already 175 basis points below the Fed’s, a record negative differential.” — Hyosung Kwon, economist For the full report, click hereBloomberg Terminal A change in tone may come later this year, according to Barclays and NH Investment & Securities Co. Son expects the BOK to start cutting rates as early as November as domestic demand softens and inflationary pressures ease, while Kang Seungwon, a fixed income strategist at NH Investment, sees rate cut bets forming as early as September — or as soon as investors are confident the Fed is ready to stop hiking. “Even during the Coronavirus pandemic, the BOK looked to the Fed before cutting rates,” and it won’t be very different this time, Kang said. Once the central bank embarks on an easing cycle, the rate cuts may come in rapid succession, he said.']\n",

While the consensus estimate for June’s consumer price index is for a 3.1% annualized pace, the bank’s team including Andrew Tyler sees a four-in-five chance for the data to arrive in line or below the estimate, a range of outcomes that can bolster equities, all else equal.  In two contrasting tail-risk scenarios where the CPI reading presents a market shock, the team assigns a 10% probability that inflation slows drastically and the S&P 500 surges in response. Those odds are twice as high as the opposite situation, where a significant rebuilding in pricing pressures sends stocks reeling.  Put another way, the team expects a yearlong inflation slowdown to allow the Federal Reserve to ease off its monetary tightening campaign, a backdrop that bodes well for stocks.  “Think this print pushes the market closer to Goldilocks where we have economic growth, earnings growth, and normalized inflation,” Tyler and his colleagues wrote in a note to clients this week. “While the bull case does not require a pause/skip at the July Fed meeting, it would certainly magnify the upside potential.”  In the most likely scenario laid out by the team, CPI comes in between 3% and 3.2%, and the S&P 500 adds 0.5% to 0.75%. An inflation reading at 2.7% or lower is expected to spark a rally of at least 2.5% in the equity benchmark.  The trajectory of inflation has become a focal point for Wall Street traders in recent years, particularly after the Fed under-estimated the stickiness of pricing pressure and then rushed to hike interest rates at a pace not seen in decades.  Market volatility regularly spiked around the release in 2022 though angst has receded this year. The Cboe 1-Day Volatility Index, a gauge of the S&P 500’s expected price swings in the next 24 hours, last traded near 16. That’s lower than any pre-CPI sessions in data going back to May 2022. Still, the gameplan from JPMorgan’s team shows the stakes are high for investors. To be sure, gaming on CPI day isn’t straightforward. For one, there are different flavors for the data, and people disagree on which is more important for traders. While the JPMorgan team focused on the headline number, a survey by 22V Research placed emphasis on so-called core inflation, which strips out food and energy.  In 22V’s survey of clients, almost two-thirds of the respondents expect core CPI to be lower than the 5% forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey. About 54% of them consider the event as risk-on.   The S&P 500 has moved an average 1.6% on CPI days in the past year. This time, the implied move from the options market is around 0.7%, according to Danny Kirsch, head of options at Piper Sandler & Co.']\n",

Debt arrangers for the Latin American country may start taking orders for the transaction in the coming days, said the people, who asked not to be named ahead of a public announcement. No final decision about whether to push ahead with the transaction has been made, the people said.  Mexican officials, including María del Carmen Bonilla — the head of the finance ministry’s public credit unit — are holding a series of calls with domestic and international investors, the people said. The investor outreachBloomberg Terminal is being organized by six banks, including HSBC Holdings Plc.  A press official for the finance ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. HSBC also didn’t respond.  The potential offer would be the first issue of so-called “BonoS” — a new type of government-issued debt linked to the sustainable development goals of the United Nations — which would be sold at fixed rates with maturities ranging from three to 30 years, Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio said in June.   The bonds can be settled via Euroclear, making it easier for international investors to buy the securities. Demand from international investors for Latin American local currency bonds has improved in recent months. Central banks in the region started tightening credit conditions to rein in inflation before policy makers in the US and elsewhere followed suit. Now, some countries are beginning to cut rates or are expected to do so, a move that typically boosts valuations of debt securities.

      "['Whatever theories are being proffered as to why index overseers chose to cap the influence of technology megacaps in the Nasdaq 100, the real reason is a simple one.  The special rebalance, the first ever of its kind, is intended to prevent fund managers linked or benchmarked to the index from violating a Securities and Exchange Commission diversification rule. Specifically, it’s one that limits the aggregate weight of the largest stock holdings — those with a 5% representation or greater — to 50%, according to Cameron Lilja, vice president and global head of index product and operations at Nasdaq. “This methodology rule is in place to ensure that any funds that are tracking the Nasdaq 100 remain in compliance with the Regulated Investment Company diversification rule,” he said in an interview. The comment sheds light on the unprecedented action, which focused attention on huge gains this year by firms such as Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. While it’s tempting to frame the rebalance as a response to warnings the narrowness of the rally somehow doomed its future, the truth was a bit more clinical. “From our perspective, the motivation to reduce index concentration is purely from the regulatory angle,” Lilja said.  The rebalance, scheduled to take effect July 24, is expected to reduce the influence of six tech giants — Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet Inc., Nvidia Corp., Amazon.com Inc., and Tesla Inc., while boosting the presence of other members in the Nasdaq 100.  While details on the action won’t be announced until later this week, a paper on the Nasdaq website says special rebalancings can be called when the portion represented by the index’s biggest members exceeds a preset threshold. In one scenario, the document says, weights can be pared back if the combined influence of the largest companies — those making up 4.5% or more of the gauge — adds up to more than 48%.  Data compiled by Bloomberg show that was the case on July 3, when the six companies saw their combined weight reach 50.9%. The Nasdaq methodology paper suggests a rebalancing may be enacted to reduce the group’s influence to 40%.  Companies set to benefitBloomberg Terminal from the rebalance include Starbucks Corp., Mondelez International Inc. and Booking Holdings Inc., according to an analysis from Wells Fargo & Co. strategists including Chris Harvey.  The revision means index-tracking funds such as Invesco QQQ Trust (ticker QQQ) need to tweak holdings. While that presents a headwind for tech megacaps in the near term, the event won’t pose a lasting threat, Harvey and his colleagues wrote in a note.   “We believe this liquidity event dents — but does not break — the longer-term uber-cap trend,” they said.  The rebalance is a consequence of the unstoppable rally in the six tech firms, an advance that’s mostly fueled by optimism over artificial intelligence. Their shares have advanced 62% on average year-to-date, almost three times as large as the average stock in the Nasdaq 100. From Opinion: Worried About Megacaps?

      "['Ireland is planning to establish a public investment fund to help sustain capital spending if the economy hits a “sharp” downturn, according to the country’s budget chief. Finance Minister Michael McGrath said the new mechanism, which is being set up in parallel with a sovereign wealth fund, is meant to “smooth” public investment levels and allow the government to “invest through the cycle” of the economy. No decisions on the size of the fund have been made but McGrath hopes to bring a proposal to fellow ministers in the coming weeks for approval, he told reporters Tuesday at the Department of Finance’s annual policy conference in Dublin. Further details are likely to be contained in the country’s annual budget in October, while it may take as long as a year to pass the legislation underpinning the funds, he added.

It will be capitalized by a surge in corporation tax receipts that’s widened the country’s budget surplus in recent years but may not last. The ministry has said the fund will receive at least €34 billion ($37.4 billion) by 2030, with lawmakers deciding over the coming months how much to save each year. A minimum annual contribution of €4 billion and a maximum of €12 billion will be made and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar last month saidBloomberg Terminal he would like to see them “at the upper end of the scale.” Ireland has estimated it could collect €24 billion in corporation tax this year, of which €12 billion could be “windfall” receipts unlikely to be sustained over the long term.

That compares with a profit on investment activities of $19 billion in 2021 as markets rallied in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.  Sign up for our Middle East newsletter and follow us  @middleeast for news on the region. The Public Investment Fund, which now manages about $778 billion in assets, didn’t disclose a figure for shareholder returns for 2022 when the S&P 500 Index dropped almost 20%. In 2021, it made a 25% return, roughly in line with that of investors in the S&P for the period.  This year’s results mean that the fund’s net loss attributable to its owner was 36.6 billion riyals ($9.8 billion) in 2022, compared with a profit of 81.8 billion riyals a year earlier, according to the wealth fund’s accounts published Tuesday.

The fund has been snapping up stakes in video game makers and electric carmakers, as well as funding new cities in the desert as it seeks to amass $2 trillion in assets by 2030. In recent months, it has grabbed global attention for a deal to merge its upstart LIV golf tournament with the PGA, part of a push by the kingdom to boost its soft power and improve its image internationally by investing in global sports.  The PIF isn’t the only sovereign entity to be hit by the slump in global markets as investors fretted about inflation, higher borrowing costs, and the fallout from the war in Ukraine. On Tuesday, Singapore’s state-owned investor Temasek Holdings Pte reported its worst return in seven years and a rare net loss, also citing the slump in equities. Norway’s $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund also reported its biggest loss since the 2008 financial crisis for last year.

During the course of 2022, the fund established the Sports Investment Company as a wholly owned subsidiary to invest in sports internationally and within the country.

      "['A gauge of the dollar’s strength fell to a three-month low before a US inflation report that may reinforce bets the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its tightening campaign. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index dropped as much as 0.3% to the weakest since April 14 on Wednesday, pressured as the US currency broke below a key 140 level versus the yen. The greenback is approaching its weakest against the Swiss franc since 2015, while the pound is on the cusp of hitting $1.30 for the first time in over a year. The moves have picked up this week as economists expect June figures to show US consumer-price growth decelerated on an annual basis, with the headline print likely to have fallen to the lowest since March 2021. “Expectations of the Fed reaching the end of its rate-hiking cycle and further cooling of US CPI will likely reinforce bearish dollar bets,” said Ken Cheung, strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Traders may also be trimming their long dollar positions in carry trades.” Bullish dollar bets are losing appeal among traders as signs mount that US interest rates may be approaching a peak. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has tumbled more than 10% from its September peak and hedge funds turned negative on the currency for the first time since March. Pricing in the options market also reflects a shift in sentiment in the US currency. One-month risk reversals closed on Tuesday at 0.17 vol, suggesting that traders are the least bullish for the greenback on a trade-weighted basis since September 2020. The greenback’s losses this week coincided with a resurgence in other Group-of-10 currencies. The yen, which has the second-largest weighting in the Bloomberg gauge after the euro, was the day’s biggest outperformer Wednesday as traders positioned for the possibility that the Bank of Japan may modify its yield curve control policy later this month.  Expectations of more rate hikes by the Bank of England and also the Swiss National Bank were supporting the pound and the franc.  “The dollar is firmly on the backfoot,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. The Dollar Index is likely to lurch lower, and weaker-than-expected US CPI “could certainly deliver the catalyst for this move.” Wednesday’s inflation print could add to the view that the US economy is heading for a soft landing, which would eventually stoke demand for riskier assets and weigh on the dollar. But it may be too early for the tide to turn on the dollar on the CPI reading alone, some analysts say. “There likely needs to be more of a slowdown in US growth/activity data before the turn to a more sustained trend lower in US yields and USD,” said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo in London.  “We could get some tactical USD selling after the CPI, but I don’t think we’re yet at a point where USD is on a sustained path lower. The relative growth dynamics need to change — we especially need to see some improvement in European and Chinese growth prospects for a weaker USD,” he added.']\n",

      "['JPMorgan’s Philip Camporeale says those Treasury bill investors happily collecting their 5% return need to wake up. “They’re sitting there in the three-month bill at five-plus percent and they’re saying, ‘I’m safe here,’” the portfolio manager for multi-asset solutions at JPMorgan Asset Management Inc. told Bloomberg Television’s Surveillance on Tuesday. Meanwhile, a balanced fund is up 10% in the first six months of this year, so T-bill investors’ “opportunity costs just went up,” he said. Whereas, three-month US Treasury bills currently yield above 5.2%, an unexpected stock market rally has pushed the S&P 500 up more than 15% in 2023, while a proxy for the bond market, the Bloomberg US Aggregated Bond Index, has returned 1.1% so far this year. His reasoning is based on the firm’s forecast for the US economy likely avoiding a recession, with the Federal Reserve engineering a so-called soft landing after raising rates for more than a year to arrest inflation before pausing at its June policy meeting. “It was a foregone conclusion there would be a recession this year,” he said. “We have dropped our recession probability from 40% in March to 25% now. We are pretty highly convicted that we’re in the midst of a soft landing.” “I’m not saying get out of cash and go into equities,” Camporeale said. “When you’re making a bet on a balanced, diversified portfolio, which has worked over so many years, you’re not making a bet on stocks or bonds. You’re making a bet on the relationship of those two asset classes which was absolutely inverted last year.”  Subscribe to Merryn Talks Money on Apple PodcastsSubscribe to Merryn Talks Money on Spotify  Inflation in the US is going to continue falling, says founder of Intertemporal Economics Brian Pelligrini, and much faster than one might think. He joins Merryn Somerset Webb on this week’s episode of Merryn Talks Money to share his predictions. Indeed, the rate of inflation will drop so quickly that it will unnerve the US Federal Reserve, he says.   Pelligrini contends signs of the decline can be seen in inventory levels, factory prices in China and the labor market. He argues that it’s also reasonable to think the Fed will turn to monetary easing in the not-too-distant future, claiming the central bank has become politicized. Going forward, he warns that if interest rates stay too low this time around, there’s every chance of another inflation explosion. So what should investors do? Pelligrini says look at energy and look at agriculture. And if you ever have to choose between gold or Bitcoin, choose gold, he says. We can be almost certain people will still value gold in a decade, says Pelligrini. We can’t say that about Bitcoin.']\n",

The cash, invested in the health care-focused hedge fund through separately managed accounts, will be leveraged up to $550 million, according to a letter to prospective investors seen by Bloomberg. Cutter is looking to raise an additional $200 million for its flagship fund, offering a founders’ share class with cheaper fees that will open to investors Oct. 1.   Aita’s market-neutral fund will bet on and against health care, with a focus on US and European pharmaceutical and biotech stocks. The firm expects “groundbreaking” health care news to include results from a landmark obesity study, the launch of a new class of treatments for Alzheimer’s and potentially “paradigm shifting” approaches to auto-immune diseases, according to the letter. “In each of these opportunities, there is the potential for news flow to uproot the foundational standard of care in their respective medical specialties,” the firm said in the letter.  A spokesman for the New York-based firm declined to comment.  Before starting Cutter, Aita spent seven years at Ken Griffin’s Citadel, most recently as a portfolio manager for its stock-picking business, Surveyor Capital, where he traded health care stocks.

      "['Deutsche Bank AG defeated a final attempt by M.M. Warburg & Co. to make it pay a €63 million ($69 million) tax bill linked to the sprawling Cum-Ex scandal that’s ensnared some of the world’s biggest financial firms.  The Federal Court of Justice, Germany’s top civil court, rejected a request by Warburg to be allowed to appeal a lower-court ruling in the dispute. The order was issued a week ago but hasn’t been made public yet, according to the court’s press office.  Warburg had sued in a Frankfurt court to make Deutsche Bank pick up the tab for part of a bill related to deals that were under review in Germany’s first Cum-Ex trial, in Bonn, which ended with convictions of a pair of British traders in 2020. Both the trial and appeals courts in Frankfurt dismissed the action. Warburg argued that Deutsche Bank was responsible for transferring money to the tax authorities more than a decade ago — as part of its role as a custodian for the short seller in the disputed transactions. Cum-Ex trades, named for the Latin term for “With-Without,” took advantage of German tax laws that seemed to allow multiple investors to claim refunds on a dividend levy that was paid only once. The practice ended in 2012 when Germany revised its rules and the trades may have cost taxpayers more than €10 billion. The top judges didn’t give any reasons for their decision so Warburg can’t comment on the ruling, a spokeswoman for the Hamburg-based bank said in an email. The case is: BGH, XI ZR 65/22.    On June 16, the same day Secretary of State Antony Blinken was set to fly to Beijing for meetings with senior Chinese officials, the State Department he oversees reported anomalous activity to Microsoft that the tech firm later blamed on China-based hackers. It was Blinken’s second try at making the high-profile trip. His first attempt in February was derailed at the last minute by the discovery of an alleged Chinese spy balloon floating above the US — which President Joe Biden ordered shot down by the US Air Force. This time, the Biden administration is staying the course on its China-engagement strategy, continuing the string of contact with Beijing that began with Blinken. But the hacking episode underlines the growing risks of restarting crucial diplomatic engagement between the world’s two largest economies when geopolitical competition between Washington and Beijing remains as fierce as ever.   Blinken’s trip last month — the most senior US delegation to China in five years — was only the first of several visits aimed at trying to reestablish more durable diplomatic links that China mostly severed in the wake of then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s controversial stop in Taiwan. China responded to Pelosi’s trip by holding unprecedented military drills around Taiwan. Similar exercises were held in April, when Taiwan’s leader, Tsai Ing-wen, met House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the US.   “At the end of the day, they get to decide whether they’re gonna do these meetings or not, and they seem to be feeling they want to put some skin in the game to see where this can lead,” said Christopher Johnson, the president of China Strategies Group, a political risk consultancy, and a former senior China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency.  “If something really significant were to happen, like a mash-up in the South China Sea or something bad, then obviously that would be it. But I think garden-variety cyber and stuff like that, I don’t think that’s enough,” he added. China has shown a similar commitment. Beijing shrugged off Biden’s reference to Xi as a “dictator” days after Blinken’s visit, still welcoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in China weeks later. US climate envoy John Kerry is set to arrive in Beijing on Sunday.  Blinken raised the issue of hacking on Thursday in a meeting with China’s top foreign policy official Wang Yi on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations foreign ministers meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, a senior State Department official told reporters.  The agency wouldn’t say if Blinken had raised the latest incident, which included the alleged breach of the email account of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Before the revelations, she’d been both one of those seeking to visit China as part of the engagement efforts and a leading figure in the administration’s moves to limit Beijing’s access to high-tech semiconductors and chip-making equipment. The hack that was revealed this week was a “sophisticated” example of China’s increasingly advanced cyber abilities, according to George Barnes, the deputy director of the US National Security Agency. It was “yet another example of what is happening around us every day,” he told a conference of intelligence professionals in Maryland on Thursday. “China is steadfast and determined to penetrate our government, our companies, our critical infrastructure.”  China routinely accuses the US of hacking. The Foreign Ministry in Beijing this week called the US “the world’s biggest hacking empire and global cyber thief,” and asked for Washington to explain its own activities. Amid the continuing current of irritants in the relationship with China, Republican lawmakers have stepped up criticism of Biden’s diplomatic strategy. Mike Gallagher, who chairs a House select committee on competition with China, derides it as “zombie engagement.”   On Thursday, Gallagher’s committee announced a hearing next week on the Biden administration’s China strategy that will see will see three senior policy appointees appear as witnesses: Ely Ratner, the assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs; Daniel Kritenbrink, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs; and Thea Rozman Kendler, the assistant secretary of commerce for export administration. Earlier this week, Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, issued a subpoena to Blinken for documents related to the administration’s moves against China. Using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China, he accused the State Department of “continued weakness and passivity in the face of PRC aggression.”  The administration rejects that criticism, highlighting the numerous sanctions and other export controls that it’s imposed.  “One of the things we heard over and over from Chinese officials is their deep protests and their deep complaints about the competitive actions that we have taken,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday.']\n",

      "['Yen bulls that have reaped nothing but disappointment in 2023 are finally eyeing gains as the currency climbs to its strongest in a month. Predictions that the yen was poised for a 10% rally as Japan relented on its ultra-dovish monetary policy have yet to pan out, but signs that the currency is at a turning point are mounting. So, rather than changing their positions, some international investors are diversifying their rationale, and increasingly pinning their hopes for yen strength on the start of a global recession.  It’s easy to see why. The odds major economies will crash are rising as central banks are forced to keep tightening amid stickier-than-expected inflation, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. economists. With that in mind, the yen — which tends to benefit from safe-haven flows — looks chronically undervalued as the currency’s trade-weighted, inflation-adjusted exchange rate hovers around lows last seen in 1971. “We’re only going to get closer to that eventual global recessionary risk and the likelihood of that is only increasing as we get into year-end and next year,” said Viraj Patel, a strategist at Vanda Research, who sees the yen gaining about 20% if the world economy rolls over. “It’s just a matter of timing rather than the catalyst being wrong.” Indeed, the currency has climbed 3.6% this month, outperforming almost all other Group-of-10 currencies after notching the worst performance among peers in the first half. It strengthened past the closely watched psychological level of 140 per dollar on Wednesday in a five-day winning streak. In the options market, investors also appear to be positioning for a stronger yenBloomberg Terminal ahead of Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan rate decisions later this month. Coming into this year, yen bulls had every reason to be optimistic. The government had propped up the yen for the first time since 1998 — effectively putting a floor under the currency. Japan’s central bank seemed on course to tighten its highly accommodative monetary policy. And other central banks looked set to cut rates as their economies slowed. Instead, the yen slipped back toward the levels that had prompted intervention in September and October, Japan’s policymakers have stayed pat, and the Fed has continued raising interest rates to try to control inflation. UBS Global Wealth Management sees timing a US recession as now key to the yen’s performance.  While the Swiss money manager has trimmed its forecast, Dominic Schnider — head of global foreign exchange and commodities — remains bullish, expecting the Japanese currency will finish 2023 almost 9% stronger at 128 per dollar. The currency should climb once US data starts to moderate, he said. “Having long-yen exposure also acts as a risk-off hedge in a portfolio context should renewed financial market stress emerge,” he added, pointing to a March bounce in the yen as a handful of US regional banks crashed.   Capital Economics has also stood by a call for yen strength, with a year-end target of 130. The firm expects safe assets to regain lost ground in the second half as developed economies tip into recession and the appetite for risk sours. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast dollar-yen at 135 in six months, while the forwards market points to a more moderate path of appreciation. Dollar-yen risk reversals over the next six and 12 months have stayed within negative territory since November, indicating that options traders are also expecting the pair to drop.  Still, plenty on Wall Street remain to be convinced. Asset managers added to their bets against the yen last week, boosting such wagers to the highest this year, and leveraged funds also increased their short positions. JPMorgan revised on Friday its dollar-yen target by year-end to 152 from 142, implying about 9% depreciation of the Japanese currency. But the rationale for a yen rally — at some point — is hard to dismiss for those with the stomach to stick around. Bank of America Corp. sees a modest almost 4% slide for the yen to 145 by year-end, but with room for the yen to advance next year as a broader downturn takes hold. When the US central bank is finally forced to cut rates — around mid-2024 according to BofA estimates  — the yen will finally appreciate, said Athanasios Vamvakidis, a strategist at the US bank. “It’s all a matter of time,” he said.']\n",

      "['A South African government delegation will embark on a charm offensive in the US this week in a bid to defuse tensions with the African nation’s second-biggest trading partner over foreign policy and retain its preferential access to American markets. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana is among those who plan to meet with US lawmakers and lobby for South Africa to retain its eligibility to export goods duty free to the US under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The officials also intend to try and dispel what the government has termed misinformation about its stance toward Russia’s war in Ukraine. South Africa has maintained what it terms a non-aligned position toward the invasion, a stand that has irked Washington. Tensions spiked earlier this year when the US ambassador to South Africa, Reuben Brigety, accused South Africa of supplying arms to Russia — an allegation Pretoria denied.  Several US lawmakers have called on President Joe Biden’s administration to reconsider whether South Africa should continue to benefit from AGOA. Besides being angered over South Africa’s foreign policy stance, some legislators argue that Africa’s most-industrialized nation is too developed to participate in the program. Read more: South Africa Says It Has US Support to Host AGOA Forum This Year “There’s no officially expressed view that seeks to exclude South Africa from AGOA,” said Vincent Magwenya, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s spokesman. “This is despite some politicians in the US lobbying for our exclusion. AGOA is coming up for renewal towards the end of this year, and naturally, it will be reviewed as it happens with all trade agreements. That review will not only apply to South Africa but to all participating countries.” AGOA expires in 2025 and US officials have previously said the qualifying criteria may be revised or the program may be replaced. South Africa ships cars and agricultural produce to the US under the accord. Last year, it exported $2.7 billion worth of goods using AGOA and the so-called Generalized System of Preferences. The Democratic Alliance, South Africa’s main opposition party, has waged its own campaign for South Africa to continue participating in AGOA and warned that its exclusion would have a devastating impact on the economy, with the vehicle manufacturing industry among those that would be badly affected. “Should South Africa’s access to AGOA be revoked as a consequence of its allegiance to Russia, 112,000 jobs in the automotive sector and 435 billion ($23 billion) in automotive trade could be wiped out,” the party said in a statement on Tuesday. “South Africans need to realize that our country’s jobs and the security of our economy are intrinsically linked to trade founded on global alliances.”  ']\n",

      "['Russia’s current-account surplus slumped in the second quarter from its peak a year earlier, reflecting a rapidly worsening trade situation that’s putting the ruble under pressure. The surplus in the current account — roughly the difference between exports and imports — decreased to $5.4 billion in the last quarter, from $76.7 billion in the same period in 2022, according to preliminary central bank data published on Tuesday. It’s the smallest surplus since the third quarter of 2020.  Plummeting revenues from energy exports are cutting into proceeds that have provided the Kremlin with a critical source of hard currency since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. With the economy under unprecedented sanctions in response to the war, lower crude prices and capped gas flows to Europe are combining with a recovery in imports to narrow a windfall that reached a record $233 billion in 2022. The central bank still expects a current account surplus of $47 billion this year and $38 billion in 2024. On Tuesday, it said in a statement that Russia’s worsening trade balance was caused by a decrease in export volumes as well as the decline in prices mainly for energy exports.  The current account balance turned negative in June due to seasonal factors and dividend payments by Russian companies amid an unfavorable market environment, the bank said.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated the lower price of oil contributed $25 billion to the second-quarter drop in the surplus year-on-year, while rising imports likely cut it by a similar margin. Much of the remainder was due to the drop in gas export volumes and prices, according to a report. “We think the main drivers of the current account will continue to be domestic demand growth, rising fast due to a significant loosening in fiscal policy and oil prices,” Goldman analysts including Clemens Grafe said. “Russia’s external balance continues to deteriorate as energy sanctions bite and loose domestic policies push demand for imports up. A weaker trade balance means Russia’s ruble will remain weak as well, on our estimates, lifting inflation close to 5% this year. We expect the current account surplus in 2023 to shrink to less than a fifth of last year’s $233 billion. The narrower external balance will mean Russia’s ability to direct capital to acquire assets and infrastructure it needs to avoid sanctions will diminish as well.” —Alexander Isakov, Russia economist.  The deterioration in external finances is keeping the Russian currency under strain and stoking its volatility.  The ruble lost 13% against the dollar in the second quarter, the worst performance in emerging markets behind Argentina’s peso and the Turkish lira. One-month implied volatility, a measure of turbulence in the currency, is the world’s highest. “Due to the sanctions, the ruble exchange rate now only reflects current account flows,” Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of currency strategy at Commerzbank AG, said in a report. “Hence, the ruble is likely to depreciate medium-term due to the declining current account surplus.”']\n",

      "['A year after inflation galvanized bets against the US stock market, it’s becoming Exhibit A for those wagering that this year’s rally will continue.  Since the consumer price index surged by a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, it has pulled back steadily in the face of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy onslaught. That’s expected to continue on Wednesday, when economists forecast that the Labor Department will report the index rose just 3.1% last month — the smallest annual increase since March 2021. That slowdown has given support to the stock-market’s surge this year by justifying speculation that the Fed is nearly done, even if there are still a few more hikes to come. The bulls have strong precedent for their enthusiasm: Since the 1950s, inflation peaks have almost always been followed by double-digit equity gains, according to data compiled by the Leuthold Group.  “It appears the Fed is winning its fight against inflation,” said Adam Sarhan, founder of 50 Park Investments.  “I’m operating like we’re in the beginning of a new bull market until any significant weakness says otherwise,” he said. “There needs to be a reason to sell. As long as inflation isn’t a major threat and the Fed doesn’t change its stance on rates, this is a golden opportunity to buy stocks.” The S&P 500 Index has gained more than 20% since it bottomed out in October, placing it up about 15% since the peak CPI data was released in July 2022. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index is up 40% from last year’s lows, fueled in part by enthusiasm for advances in artificial intelligence.  The key driver, though, has been the hope that easing inflation pressures will allow the Fed this year to wind up the monetary policy campaign that’s pushed its benchmark rate from near zero in early 2022 to its current range of 5%-5.25%.  With Fed policymakers heading into a silent period next week, traders are focused on this week’s CPI release for insight into the central bank’s likely path. After last week’s jobs report signaled a slowdown in a still-strong labor market, the figures will set the stage for stocks leading up to the central bank’s rate decision on July 26 and Chair Jerome Powell’s subsequent press conference.  Of course, there remain plenty of risks for the stock market, and traders this year have repeatedly pushed out the timing of when the Fed’s rate will peak as the economy held up better than expected. Many Wall Street strategists have also maintained a bearish outlook, expecting that equities will fall during the second half of the year as growth slows.  Wall Street Soothsayers Are Bewildered About What’s Next What’s more, stronger-than-expected wage growth for June will likely keep the Fed on track to raise interest rates this month, with traders pricing in strong odds that it will be followed by one more such increase this year. So any sign that inflation is still stubbornly elevated may put pressure on pricey corners of the stock market, particularly technology companies that have left the Nasdaq 100 trading around 29 times projected earnings. “AI will be a very big thing for investors over the next decade, but you have to be careful in the short run,” cautioned Cheryl Smith, portfolio manager and economist at Trillium Asset Management, citing the risk of a recession. But strategists at Wells Fargo Securities say the Fed’s monetary policy tightening is expected to keep showing gains on the inflation front at least, if history is any guide. The strategists cite the strong correlation between changes in consumer prices and those in a commonly used measure of the money supply known as M2. That measure has been contracting, which they said will likely continue to slow inflation as it pulls demand out of the economy.  “More liquidity is associated with inflation growth and vice versa,” Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo, said by email. “M2 has been contracting for over a year and is still contracting, though at a decelerating rate. If the economy muddles along and inflation comes down, it’s supportive of higher equity prices.”']\n",

The Bank of Canada is using its economic forecasts to try to prevent medium-term rates from falling too much and stoking more housing market speculation, according to a top economist. Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Bank of Nova Scotia, described Governor Tiff Macklem’s tactics as “stealth forward guidance” after the central bank raised its benchmark rate to a 22-year high of 5% on Wednesday.  The decision was accompanied by a new set of economic projections that see the economy headed for a soft landing, with growth averaging about 1% over the next 12 months. Output is then expected to pick up again, to 2.5% in 2025, while inflation eases over the next two years until it’s back at the bank’s 2% target.   To Holt, that forecast “deserves a place on the fiction shelves at your favorite bookstore or the virtual equivalent.”   In a report to investors Wednesday afternoon, the Scotiabank economist acknowledged the “slim possibility” the forecasts may prove right and that Macklem and his team may genuinely believe them. But he argued there’s another motive potentially at play: Central bank officials want to avoid speculation about rate cuts and a rally in five-year government of Canada debt.  Most mortgages in Canada are fixed-rate loans tied to five-year government notes. When their yields fall, so do borrowing costs for homeowners, and the central bank wants to avoid that outcome, Holt said.  “They’re trying to exert their influence further up the curve by producing a set of forecasts that pushes back against any tendency to more dearly price those bonds because it would mean lower fixed mortgage rates,” he wrote.  That, in turn, “would mean more fuel thrown onto the housing fires in the country alongside stronger consumption,” he wrote.  Soon after the Bank of Canada declared a conditional pause in January, home prices started to rebound. Holt concluded: “If I’m right, then this stealth guidance tool means that should markets resume testing the BoC before it is ready, then markets may court the risk that the hammer gets pulled out again with another policy rate hike to prove the point.”']\n",

      "['Schwab Asset Management is seeking to draw investors to its high-yield bond exchange-traded fund with one of the lowest fees in the industry, even as rising rates and default fears rattle the asset class. The Schwab High Yield Bond ETF, which debuts Tuesday, trades under the ticker SCYB and charges just 10 basis points annually. That matches the fee on the $1.2 billion SPDR Portfolio High Yield Bond ETF (SPHY).  While the new Schwab ETF is just a basis point away from becoming the cheapest junk bond ETF in the $75 billion category, Schwab’s David Botset is confident in its ability to attract investors. While passively managed funds such as SCYB need to be low-cost to gain traction in an increasingly saturated industry, at 10 basis points and below, it’s a marginal boost, he said.  “Cost is clearly a differentiating factor when it comes to products, especially in the index space,” Botset, Schwab’s head of equity product management and innovation, said in a phone interview. However, “what we’re increasingly seeing when you get down to that level of pricing, one or two basis points doesn’t become the tie-breaking decision.” Of the more than 100 US junk bond ETFs today, the $13.5 billion iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) is the biggest and one of the more expensive with an annual fee of 49 basis points. The $9.2 iShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (USHY) charges 15 basis points, while the $8.3 billion SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) has an expense ratio of 40 basis points. Against that backdrop, and given Schwab’s massive presence among retail investors with brokerage accounts, SCYB should flourish, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  “It’s going to be successful at raising assets,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said. “When you’ve got 34 million brokerage accounts largely made up of people who love low-cost investing, it’s a good formula for ETF assets.” SCYB sets sail as concerns over a hawkish Federal Reserve and climbing default fears rattle high-yield bonds. Those worries have driven a $6.4 billion exodus from junk bond ETFs this year while nearly $45 billion has flowed into the funds holding investment-grade rated debt. The fund’s underlying index caps exposure to any single debt issuer at 2%, which should mitigate concentration risk to any troubled firms, Botset said.  “Diversification in high-yield is really important,” Botset said. “You’re looking at an increased potential of defaults, and recoveries in that space typically aren’t as high as in investment grade.”']\n",

      "['The money-market industry is gearing up for its biggest overhaul in years.  Conference rooms are being reserved and snacks stockpiled as participants in the $5.5 trillion space await the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s vote Wednesday on rules reshaping the money-market industry for the third time since 2008. That’s when the Reserve Primary Fund, the original money market fund first created in 1970, was forced to reprice its shares below $1, in a shift that became known as “breaking the buck,” after investors pulled $40 billion in just two days. While proposed changes were revealed more than 18 months ago, it’s not clear what final rules will be approved. At one end of the spectrum are the low-hanging fruit, mainly removing the liquidity threshold that imposes fees on withdrawals and improving reporting requirements. On the other end lie more onerous policies, such as forcing investors to pay a fee to pull out funds.  “We’re all really waiting with bated breath to see where it’s going,” said Jon-Luc Dupuy, a partner at K&L Gates LLP. “I’m not a betting person normally, so I couldn’t bet what it would be.”  Read More: Money-Fund Industry Braces for Next Round of Regulatory ChangesBloomberg Terminal The 2008 financial crisis exposed major issues with money funds, which are supposed to be ultra-safe havens for individuals and companies to park cash, and regulators spent years implementing measures intended to slow withdrawals during times of stress. But the last round of changes instituted in 2016 didn’t prevent the kinds of outflows that occurred in March 2020 when the onset of the pandemic roiled markets. Instead, panicked investors yanked billions from one segment of money funds in less than two months, helping upend the entire commercial-paper market that provides a life-line to companies seeking to raise short-term cash. That run prompted the Federal Reserve to intervene in 2020 and rescue money-market funds for the second time in 12 years.  It also prompted a new round of soul searching on how to stabilize the industry. Money-market participants were already bracing for more regulations after the SEC said in June a long-awaited overhaul was on its short-list. In its rulemaking agenda, the regulator said more strictures could come as soon as October. Then an announcement last week that a vote was coming on Wednesday caught the market off guard. The best-case scenario for many in the industry would be if the SEC tackles those simpler changes like removing links between fees and liquidity levels first, with a pledge to continue working on the more complicated policies. This is similar to the post-financial crisis period when regulators adopted daily and weekly liquidity requirements, higher credit quality, and shorter maturity limits in 2010. It followed with the more onerous pieces like floating net asset values for institutional prime funds, and liquidity gates and fees in 2014.  Meanwhile, the cash parked at money-market funds climbedBloomberg Terminal to a fresh record through the week ended July 5 as short-term rates above 5% continue to lure investors to money-market assets.  Despite countless meetings with commissioners and staff, fund managers like Deborah Cunningham are still unsure as to what will be revealed on Wednesday.  “I don’t know if it’s better if I should just get a conference room for popcorn and champagne, or to collectively cry,” the chief investment officer for global liquidity markets at Federated Hermes said.']\n",

      "['Bank of America Corp. agreed to pay $150 million in fines and $100 million to customers for improperly charging extra fees, withholding rewards and opening unauthorized credit-card accounts, US regulators said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said it fined the bank for “systematically double-dipping on fees imposed on customers with insufficient funds in their account.” The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender also failed to pay promised credit-card reward bonuses and enrolled customers for cards without their knowledge or authorization, the CFPB said. Bank of America agreed to pay $90 million of the penalty to the CFPB and $60 million to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The company didn’t admit to or deny the allegations as part of the settlement.  The regulators have brought similar actions against Wells Fargo & Co. and U.S. Bancorp. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo has been under intense regulatory scrutiny for a raft of scandals dating back to 2016, including the opening of accounts without customers’ consent. More recently, the CFPB fined Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp $37.5 millionBloomberg Terminal for a similar practice. “Bank of America wrongfully withheld credit-card rewards, double-dipped on fees and opened accounts without consent,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statementBloomberg Terminal Tuesday. “These practices are illegal and undermine customer trust.” The consumer-protection agency found that Bank of America charged consumers a $35 overdraft fee and then “double-dipped” by allowing fees to be charged repeatedly for the same transaction, according to the statement. That allowed the bank to generate “substantial additional revenue,” the bureau said. Bank of America said in an emailed statement that it “voluntarily reduced overdraft fees and eliminated all non-sufficient fund fees in the first half of 2022.” It declined to address the case or the allegations against the lender. This isn’t Bank of America’s first recent regulatory penalty. A year ago, the lender was fined $225 million for unfair and deceptive practices related to a prepaid-card program to distribute unemployment insurance and other public-benefit payments during the pandemic. It was also ordered to pay a $10 million penalty and repay fees that the lender charged customers when garnishing wages. Separately on Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission announcedBloomberg Terminal a $6 million penalty settling charges against Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit for failing to file hundreds of Suspicious Activity Reports from 2009 to 2019. Merrill also agreed to pay another $6 million to settle related charges brought by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Bank of America, which also didn’t admit to or deny the SEC’s allegations, said it self-reported the issues to regulators. The firm, which merged with Merrill Lynch in 2009, said in an emailed statement that it has “enhanced our process and training regarding these filings.” Bank of America shares rose 1.1% to $28.96 at 12:24 p.m. in New York. They’ve fallen 13% this year. The bank announced in early 2022 it would cut back on the fees it charges customers for failing to have enough money in their accounts to cover checks and debit-card charges. Lawmakers and consumer activists have criticized the fees, with Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, saying they “snatch billions from struggling families” and that “big banks raked in billions from this abusive practice” during the Covid-19 pandemic. Bank of America didn’t completely eliminate overdraft fees, but took some steps to alleviate the impact on consumers. It did away with the transfer fee associated with its Balance Connect for overdraft-protection service and cut its overdraft fees. The lender considered removing overdraft charges completely, but ultimately opted for a reduced fee, executives have said. The consumer-protection bureau also alleged that, dating back to 2012, Bank of America employees opened credit-card accounts for customers without their knowledge to reach sales goals imposed upon the workers. Those actions led to unjustified fees being charged and negative impacts on credit profiles, according to the statement. The sales incentives have since been removed, the agency said. The bank also withheld promised cash rewards or bonus points earned by tens of thousands of customers when signing up for Bank of America credit cards, regulators said. “Bank of America has clearly broken the law in yet another case of Wall Street banks taking Americans’ money to pad their already massive profits,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement. In addition to the monetary penalties, the bank must change its business practices, by halting the practice of opening unauthorized accounts, disclosing limits on credit-card rewards and bonuses, and no longer charging repeat fees for non-sufficient funds.']\n",

China’s attempts to encourage foreign investors have ramped up in recent weeks as it’s become clear that the economy’s recovery following the end of Beijing’s Covid Zero policies is starting to flag. Earlier this week, authorities took a step toward supporting the ailing property market by extending loan relief for developers. Other major components of the economy remain sluggish such as consumer spending and exports, while recent data point to deepening deflation. A clampdown this year on foreign consultancy firms that help global investors and multinational firms understand China — part of a nationwide anti-espionage campaign — has weakened the appetite for investment from overseas firms.  During US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s recent trip to Beijing, she raised concerns over China’s “non-market” practices and “coercive actions” against American firms.

      "['OPEC’s petroleum export revenues climbed to the highest in a almost a decade last year, as Russia’s war on Ukraine bolstered crude prices and key members ramped up production. The 13 nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries earned $873.6 billion in 2022, up 54% from the prior year, according to a report from the group’s secretariat on Tuesday. It was their best year since 2014, when the US shale boom ended a period of historically high oil prices.  Crude soared last year as energy flows from Russia, which joined with the cartel in 2016 in a wider network known as OPEC+, were disrupted by international backlash against its military aggression. Brent futures averaged about $99 a barrel, the highest since 2014. Meanwhile, OPEC nations such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE opened the taps to satisfy the post-pandemic recovery in fuel demand. The combination of surging prices and increased output pushed up earnings for the entire group.  The basket of crude grades typically sold by OPEC nations averaged just over $100 a barrel in 2022, while Bloomberg estimates show that crude production from its 13 states was roughly 29.2 million barrels a day. The figures for petroleum revenue also include sales of refined products.  OPEC’s earnings peaked at roughly $1.2 trillion in 2012, just as the use of hydraulic fracturing — also known as fracking — was unlocking a gusher of shale-oil in American states from Texas to North Dakota. The ensuing market crash spurred the Saudis and Russia, once fierce rivals, to form the OPEC+ coalition in 2016. Revenue comparisons between then and now are complicated slightly by changes in OPEC’s membership. Countries including Qatar and Ecuador have quit the group while others such as Equatorial Guinea and Gabon have joined.  This year, OPEC+ is once again engaged in production cuts to prop up crude markets, as China’s economic recovery disappoints and tightening interest rates in the US and elsewhere stir fears of a recession. Last week, the Saudis announced they would prolong an extra 1 million barrel—a-day cutback into August, and Russia made a new pledge to pare exports. Yet the measures are struggling to support the market as the economic outlook frays and supplies exceed expectations from OPEC+ members such as Iran, Venezuela and — despite its repeated promises of restraint — Russia. Brent remains under $80 a barrel, far below the levels the kingdom apparently needs to cover government spending. ']\n",

      "['Citigroup Inc. named Flavio Figueiredo global head of foreign-exchange trading, making him the third leader in 16 months for one of the bank’s biggest businesses by revenue. Figueiredo, 58, was most recently head of corporate sales and solutions, and will continue to support that division while the bank looks for his replacement, according to a memo to staff Tuesday.  The 34-year Citigroup veteran takes over a currency-trading business that has snagged the No. 1 market-share ranking from Coalition Greenwich for 10 straight years. The business benefits from the bank’s deep relationships with some of the world’s biggest companies, helping chief financial officers and treasurers hedge their foreign-exchange exposure.  The currency-trading operation “has long been a defining business of Citi — a truly global powerhouse,” Figueiredo said. The executive assumes the top perch from Leo Arduini, who has held the position on an interim basis since Stu Staley stepped down from the role in April. Staley had only been named sole leader of the business just months earlier after his former co-head, Itay Tuchman, departed.  Citigroup’s foreign-exchange trading division, which can trace its roots to 1897, became one of the biggest on Wall Street by capitalizing on the bank’s longstanding relationships with CFOs at Fortune 500 companies, ties forged through the firm’s sprawling treasury and trade solutions business, which moves $4 trillion a day for clients. Those contacts generate a steady stream of trades as corporate finance executives use Citigroup to help them conduct everyday treasury operations such as hedging. Roughly 40% of firmwide trading revenue comes from corporate clients, Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser said at a conferenceBloomberg Terminal last month, whereas competitors such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lean more heavily on hedge funds and other asset managers.  “It gives you a more diversified flow,” the CEO said. “It’s terrific in the volatile markets as we’ve seen. And that is where we dominate is around FX, hedging and helping clients manage through the volatility for their day-to-day operations and businesses.” Citigroup’s currency traders generated a surge in revenue last year, when the figure swelled to $6 billion on increased volatility in global foreign-exchange prices, according to a person familiar with the matter. That compared with $4.5 billion in 2021, the person said.  That performance was in line with other top Wall Street firms. Combined currency-trading revenue for the 45 biggest firms jumped to $50 billion from $35 billion in 2021, according to Vali Analytics Ltd. Citigroup’s market share averaged 12.5% between 2020 and 2022, according to Coalition Greenwich data provided by the bank. That was a 250 basis-point improvement from 2015, the data show. At the same time, Citigroup has been in the midst of culling its workforce as part of a broader push by Fraser to cut costs. The firm has dismissed 5,000 workers so far this year, with the trading and investment-banking divisions bearing the brunt of the cuts. Citigroup dismantled the global team that provided commentary and analysis on foreign-exchange markets as part of the dismissals.']\n",

      "['Commerzbank AG Chief Executive Officer Manfred Knof is likely to raise a key profitability goal when he unveils his next financial targets, as the German lender benefits from rising interest rates. Knof wants Commerzbank to aim for a return on tangible equity of more than 10% under the new plan, compared with the more than 7.3% that he has pledged for next year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The lender is also considering increasing shareholder payouts as part of the new strategy, which is likely to cover the period after the current turnaround plan concludes at the end of 2024. Commerzbank’s leadership is currently discussing the new plan and intends to formally adopt it in late September, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing the private information. No final decision has been made and the details as well as the timing may still change, they said.  Commerzbank’s shares gained on the news, rising 3.4% at 2:14 p.m. in Frankfurt trading. A spokeswoman for the lender declined to comment. A return of 10% means Knof would have to more than double profitability from last year, a challenge that would require a substantial jump in revenue and probably expense cuts. While Knof’s next plan will include additional savings as well as targeted investments, he doesn’t see the need for more sweeping changes after he embarked on steep cost reductions more than two years ago, the people familiar with the discussions said.  Commerzbank, which is heavily dependent on retail and commercial banking, has been a key beneficiary of the European Central Bank interest rate increases, which have made lending more profitable across the region. A 10% RoTE is possible, “should management utilize capital buffers and continue to divert capital to higher-yielding areas in the Corporate Clients division,” KBW analysts led by Thomas Hallett said in a research note last week. That and higher payouts would be “a marked shift from the endless restructuring seen over much of the last decade.” Commerzbank has long been one of the least profitable banks in Europe, and it has also returned very little money to shareholders through dividends or buybacks since it was bailed out by the German government in the financial crisis. “We’re working to update our strategy,” Knof said at the annual general meeting in May. “Our medium-term goal is to earn our cost of capital.” Commerzbank has estimated that its cost of capital was 9.2% at the end of last year, and rising interest rates have since increased that cost, the people said. By comparison, Commerzbank only returned 4.9% on tangible equity last year. Commerzbank earlier this year mandated the consulting firm Bain to support work on the new strategy, Bloomberg has reported. Potential ideas include winning wealth management mandates from existing business clients, getting more companies to use digital services, and selling more products linked to sustainability considerations, people familiar with the matter said at the time.']\n",

      "['A Canadian pipeline hailed as a cheap and speedy way to send oil to Asia is set to become a $15 billion (C$20 billion) taxpayers’ headache and an expensive option for exporters thanks to cost overruns. The expanded Trans Mountain Pipeline will enter service early next year after nearly tripling its capacity, delivering an extra 590,000 barrels of Alberta oil each day to Vancouver. Its route cuts the time to ship Canadian crude to Asia by roughly two-thirds compared to sending via the US Gulf, but it won’t necessarily be more cost effective. Trans Mountain was touted as a way to broaden buyers of Canadian oil and break energy dependence on the US when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government bought the system from Kinder Morgan Inc. five years ago for C$4.5 billion ($3.4 billion). Since then, repeated delays and construction setbacks have seen project costs more than quadruple to C$30.9 billion, challenging the economics of the pipeline and undercutting Canada’s push to diversify oil exports. Read More: Canadian Pipeline Gets Extra Government Support as Costs Balloon “The economics of this project don’t make sense because the financial benefit is not there,” said Robyn Allan, an independent economist who has published reports critical of the project. Trans Mountain announced interim tolls for its expanded pipeline in June and is seeking approval from Canada’s energy regulator so the line can start operating as early as January. Only part of the cost increases for the expansion can be passed on through higher tolls, with proposed fees already too high for oil producers to make a sufficient profit, Allan said.  That means taxpayers may be left to bear a roughly C$20 billion writedown, according to Morningstar Inc analyst Stephen Ellis.  A government spokesperson declined to comment on the pipeline’s potential impact to taxpayers, but said the project was an “important investment in Canada’s economy” that would “ensure Canada receives fair market value for our resources while maintaining the highest environmental standards.”   The pipeline operator is also offering 80% of its expanded capacity to companies with contracts lasting decades.  Fees of as much as C$11.46 a barrel have already drawn rebuke from some that signed contracts, with Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. saying in a June 22 letter it may “impact the overall competitiveness of Canada’s oil industry.” A company with a 20-year contract would pay about 30 cents more per barrel to ship crude to China using Trans Mountain than via the alternative Enbridge Inc. pipeline systems to the US Gulf Coast, based on proposed tolls and term contract tanker rates, according to Skip York, chief energy strategist at Turner Mason & Co. Most Canadian oil exports to East Asia are shipped to the Gulf on Enbridge pipelines, TC Energy Corp.’s Keystone system or by rail. From there, the crude is loaded into tankers for journeys of as many as 49 days across three oceans. Trans Mountain refuted claims the line won’t be competitive. The expansion will have a cost advantage of $2.50 a barrel for shipping to China versus shipping through the Gulf Coast and a bigger advantage to Japan or South Korea, the company said in an email, without specifying how it calculated that cost. “While marine costs fluctuate around the world as conditions change, in the long run, we expect the cost advantage for Trans Mountain to be maintained.” In certain circumstances, York said the Vancouver route could be cheaper. A company with long-term contracts on Trans Mountain stands to save 40 cents a barrel to reach China over using Keystone. Spot suppliers could save $1.60 a barrel over Enbridge. Still, crude shipments from Vancouver to East Asia are relatively rare, which makes tanker rates more expensive.  And a major setback for Trans Mountain users relates to capacity limits of Aframax tankers, the largest that can access Vancouver’s marine terminal. The vessels carry less than half the volume of the so-called Very Large Crude Carriers that serve the Gulf Coast. The volume difference means that even though the journey is much shorter, shipping out of Vancouver could be pricier. The high costs of using Trans Mountain could result in much of the Canadian oil being sent to US West Coast refineries instead of getting shipped to Asia, though there are limits to how much Canada’s southern neighbor can process. Tanker rates from Vancouver could fall once the route becomes more common. But Trans Mountain won’t be the cheap route to Asia as originally billed. “The project has failed in that respect for sure,” Allan said.']\n",

      "['Singapore state-owned investor Temasek Holdings Pte is set to hold talks with Ant Group Co. to understand why it slashed its valuation before it decides whether to take part in a planned share buyback, according to Chief Investment Officer Rohit Sipahimalani. Temasek bought shares in the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.-affiliated finance company in 2018, when it was valued at $150 billion, according to an Ant prospectus in 2020. Ant’s planned repurchase of stock announced on the weekend would value the company at about 567.1 billion yuan ($78.8 billion). “With the recent developments around Ant, a line in the sand has been drawn and that should be good for the company,” Sipahimalani said in an interview, adding Ant was holding talks with all major holders. “Investors have to make their own call whether they need the liquidity or where they see the outlook for the business.” Alibaba had earlier said it was considering participating in a proposed Ant buyback. The fintech giant plans to repurchase as much as 7.6% of its shares after being ensnared by a years-long regulatory crackdown that culminated last week with a fine of almost $1 billion from Chinese regulators. The buyback valuation is almost 70% lower than an estimated $280 billion market capitalization in 2020 before it scrapped an initial public offering. Temasek is among holders of Ant’s private shares. Each investor would be allowed to sell up to 7.6% of their equity rather than cashing out completely, Bloomberg News has reported. Global investors are trying to decide whether the political and consumer challenges facing companies in China are a buying opportunity or substantial risk to their portfolio. About 22% of the Singaporean firm’s net portfolio value is based in China, making it a key concern. Temasek on Tuesday warned of an uncertain road ahead as it chalked up its worst showing in seven years. The investor with S$382 billion ($284 billion) in assets posted a decline of 5.1% for the fiscal year ended March 31.  The firm has continued to back Chinese companies this year, adding to holdings in US-listed shares of Alibaba and its rival e-commerce provider JD.Com Inc. during the first quarter of 2023, according to 13F filingsBloomberg Terminal. That’s despite Sipahimalani warning that key sectors in China are facing major challenges, from consumer sentiment to the property sector. China’s benchmark CSI 300 is among the worst-performing indexes in Asia-Pacific this year, prompting foreign funds to cut exposure as the economy weakens and relations with the US remain tense. “I think it’s going in one direction only – I don’t think that’s going to reverse,” Sipahimalani said of the growing geopolitical tensions between the US and China. Temasek favors companies with access to large domestic markets that aren’t caught in the cross-hairs. “That’s just sensible investing right now,” he told Bloomberg Television.  ']\n",

      "[\"Flows of Russian crude are starting to show signs of falling, more than four months after the country was due to slash production. Crude shipments through Russia’s western ports in the four weeks to July 9 dropped substantially below their average February level for the first time, after volumes surged during the intervening months, according to vessel tracking data monitored by Bloomberg and corroborated by other data sources.Nationwide seaborne crude flows fell to 2.86 million barrels a day in the week to July 9. That was a little more than 1 million barrels a day lower than the previous week, with 80% of the drop coming from ports in western Russia. Moscow has said previously that lower flows resulting from its output cut would be  targeted at ports on the Baltic and Black SeaBloomberg Terminal. There was no obvious sign of   maintenance at Russian ports like that which led to the big drop seen two weeks ago. With few buyers left in Europe, the impact of the lower flows is being felt in shipments to Asia, which dropped to their lowest since mid-January. The smaller volumes undermined the Kremlin’s income from export taxes, which fell by 29% last week compared with the one before. The reduction comes after Russia followed Saudi Arabia in announcing   further curbs earlier this month. The desert kingdom said it would extend its unilateral output cut through August, while Moscow pledged to reduce exports by 500,000 barrels a day. Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman called Russia’s move   meaningful Bloomberg Terminalbecause it applies to oil exports, which can be measured more effectively than production. Russia initially said in February that it would cut oil production by 500,000 barrels a day   in retaliation for Western sanctions and price caps on its oil. The Kremlin’s decision to stop disclosing production data and a lack of clear evidence that the cut was being implemented led Saudi Arabia — Russia’s co-leader of the OPEC+ producers’ group — to suggest that Moscow would benefit from being   more transparent. Meanwhile, Russia’s refineries   raised their crude-processingBloomberg Terminal rate in first days of July to the highest in 12 weeks amid robust demand for their   fuel abroad and looming cuts in domestic downstream subsidies. Figures from Russia’s Energy Ministry on crude production show that the nation   failed to fully implementBloomberg Terminal its pledged output cuts in June. Crude output averaged 9.599 million barrels a day, only 350,000 barrels a day lower than in February. On a four-week average basis, overall seaborne exports in the period to July 9 were down by 205,000 barrels a day to 3.21 million barrels a day. This compares with an average of 3.38 million barrels a day in the four weeks to Feb. 26. More volatile weekly flows plunged by about 1.04 million barrels a day to 2.86 million barrels a day. Weekly data are affected by the scheduling of tankers and loading delays caused by bad weather. Port maintenance can also disrupt exports for several days at a time.  All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade. Those are shipments made by KazTransoil JSC that transit Russia for export through the Baltic ports of Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk. The Kazakh barrels are blended with crude of Russian origin to create a uniform export grade. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Kazakhstan has rebranded its cargoes to distinguish them from those shipped by Russian companies. Transit crude is specifically exempted from European Union sanctions. Four-week average shipments to Russia’s Asian customers, plus those on vessels showing no final destination, fell to 2.93 million barrels a day in the period to July 9 from 3.13 million barrels a day in the four weeks to July 2. That’s the lowest since mid-January. Most of the cargoes on ships without an initial destination eventually end up in India. Even so, the volumes heading to the country that has become the biggest buyer of Russia’s seaborne crude are down from their recent highs. Adding the “Unknown Asia” and “Other Unknown” volumes to the total for India gives a figure of 1.85 million barrels a day in the four weeks to July 9. That’s   down from a high of 2.2 million barrels a day in the four weeks to May 21.  The equivalent of 363,000 barrels a day was on vessels showing destinations as either Port Said or Suez in Egypt, or which already have been or are expected to be transferred from one ship to another off the South Korean port of Yeosu. Those voyages typically end at ports in India or China and show up in the chart below as “Unknown Asia” until a final destination becomes apparent. The “Other Unknown” volumes, running at 268,000 barrels a day in the four weeks to July 9, are those on tankers showing no clear destination. Most of those cargoes originate from Russia’s western ports and go on to transit the Suez Canal, but some could end up in Turkey, while other cargoes are transferred from one vessel to another, either in the Mediterranean or, more recently, in the Atlantic Ocean. Russia’s seaborne crude exports to European countries were unchanged at 104,000 barrels a day in the 28 days to July 9, with Bulgaria the sole destination. These figures do not include shipments to Turkey. A market that consumed about 1.5 million barrels a day of short-haul seaborne crude, coming from export terminals in the Baltic, Black Sea and Arctic has been lost almost completely, to be replaced by long-haul destinations in Asia that are much more costly and time-consuming to serve. No Russian crude was shipped to northern European countries in the four weeks to July 9. Exports to Turkey, Russia’s only remaining Mediterranean customer, were unchanged at 177,000 barrels a day in the four weeks to July 9, their lowest four-week average level since May; flows to the country had topped 425,000 barrels a day in October. Flows to Bulgaria, now Russia’s only Black Sea market for crude, were unchanged at 104,000 barrels a day. Aggregate flows of Russian crude slumped to 2.86 million barrels a day in the seven days to July 9, from 3.90 million barrels a day the previous week. Shipments fell from all four export regions, with the biggest drops seen at Baltic and Arctic ports. Shipments from Primorsk dropped by 313,000 barrels a day, or 21%, from the previous week. Flows from Murmansk were down week-on-week by 286,000 barrels a day, but are expected to rebound in the current week, with two Suezmax tankers currently at the port. Figures exclude volumes from Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade. Vessel tracking data are cross-checked against port agent reports as well as flows and ship movements reported other data providers including Kpler SAS and Vortexa Ltd. Inflows to the Kremlin's war chest from its crude-export duty slumped to $43 million in the seven days to July 9, a drop of $17 million or 29%. Four-week average income fell by $4 million to $49 million. President Vladimir Putin ordered his government to  fine-tuneBloomberg Terminal existing indicators and establish additional ones to calculate oil prices for tax purposes in order to reduce the discount to global crude prices. Russia’s government calculates oil taxes using a discount to Brent, which sets the floor price for the nation’s crude for budget purposes. If Russian oil trades above that threshold, the Finance Ministry uses the market price for tax calculations, as has been the case in recent months. From July the discount is currently set at $25/bbl, though this may now be narrowed. The duty rate for JulyBloomberg Terminal has been set at $2.13 a barrel, based on an average Urals price of $54.57, which was $20.89 a barrel below Brent during the period between May 15 and June 14. The following charts show the number of ships leaving each export terminal and the destinations of crude cargoes from the four export regions. A total of 27 tankers loaded 20.01 million barrels of Russian crude in the week to July 9, vessel-tracking data and port agent reports show. That’s down by 7.26 million barrels from the previous week’s figure, reversing more than three-quarters of the gain seen in the period to July 2. Destinations are based on where vessels signal they are heading at the time of writing, and some will almost certainly change as voyages progress. All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade. The total volume on ships loading Russian crude from the Baltic terminals fell back to 1.15 million barrels a day, giving up three-quarters of the gain seen the previous week. The decline was concentrated at Primorsk, with flows from Ust-Luga rising week-on-week. Shipments of Russian crude from Novorossiysk in the Black Sea dropped to a seven-week low of 480,000 barrels a day. One cargo of Kazakhstani crude was also loaded at the port during the week. Arctic shipments fell sharply, dropping back to 143,000 barrels a day. Three Suezmax tankers arrived the port near the end of the week to July 9, but only one of them completed loading before the week ended. Eleven tankers loaded at Russia’s three Pacific export terminals, down from 13 the previous week. The volume of crude shipped from the region fell to 1.09 million barrels a day, giving up a little over one-third of the previous week’s gain. The volumes heading to unknown destinations are mostly Sokol cargoes that recently have been transferred to other vessels at Yeosu, or are currently being shuttled to an area off the South Korean port from the loading terminal at De Kastri. Most of these are ending up in India. Some Sokol cargoes are now being transferred a second time in the waters off southern Malaysia. A small number of ESPO shipments are also being moved from one vessel to another in the same area. All bar one of these cargoes have, so far, gone on to India. That one cargo was transferred onto a floating storage vessel off Malaysia, where it remains. One half-cargo was loaded from the Sakhalin Island terminal in the week to July 9, with the other half loaded the previous week and the vessel spending several days at anchor between the two loading operations. Maintenance at one of the Sakhalin 2 project’s oil production platforms has reduced the volume of crude available for shipping. Note: This story forms part of a regular weekly series tracking shipments of crude from Russian export terminals and the export duty revenues earned from them by the Russian government. Note: All figures exclude cargoes owned by Kazakhstan’s KazTransOil JSC, which transit Russia and are shipped from Novorossiysk and Ust-Luga as KEBCO grade crude. Note: Weeks have been revised to run from Monday to Sunday, rather than Saturday to Friday. This change has been implemented throughout the data series and previous weeks’ figures have been revised. Note: The next update will be published on Tuesday July 18, with future updates also to be published on Tuesdays.

The former co-chief investment officer hired Elliott Management veteran Jaime Hobbeheydar to run investor relations and marketing at Jain Global, the multistrategy, multimanager firm he’s launching next year, according to people familiar with the matter. Hobbeheydar, 53, recently left Elliott after leading investor relations there for 14 years. Hobbeheydar and a spokesperson for Jain declined to comment.

      "['The cost of insuring Turkey’s bonds against default sunk after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to stop blocking Sweden’s bid to join the NATO military alliance, reducing geopolitical tensions weighing on the country. Credit default swaps protecting from non-payment on Turkish bonds for five years fell 26 basis points to 460 points as of 5:06 p.m. in Istanbul, on course for the lowest close in 20 months and down from as high as 700 basis points during Erdogan’s reelection in May. The country’s dollar bonds and local stocks rallied while the lira extended its slide. “Make no mistake, this is a very big deal for Turkey,” said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. “Perhaps this is yet another baby step toward Turkey becoming investable once again.” Sign up for our Middle East newsletter and follow us  @middleeast for news on the region. Geopolitical risks have helped sap demand for Turkish assets as ties between Erdogan and key western allies had been strained by Istanbul’s blockade of Sweden’s membership in NATO and its purchase of a Russian missile system. Since the election, however, Erdogan has been gradually warming relations and rolling back unorthodox economic policies in hopes of luring back foreign capital to rejuvenate the Turkish economy.  “After years of deteriorating relations with the West, it appears that Turkey is finally realizing that closer relations with Russia was not a good look,” BBH’s Thin said. Turkey Agrees to Back Sweden’s NATO Bid in Boost to Alliance In another encouraging sign for investors, Erdogan is due to meet US President Joe Biden at a NATO summit in Lithuania in Tuesday, where they’re due to discuss Turkey’s request to purchase F-16 jets.  Turkey’s lira’s traded 0.1% weaker at 26.11 against the dollar, continuing its depreciation since Turkish authorities allowed more currency flexibility in the wake of the ballot, part of its approach of gradually abandoning unorthodox economic policies. The yield on Turkey’s 10-year dollar bond fell 28 basis points to 8.74% while the benchmark Borsa Istanbul Banks Index rose 4.9% With the country’s foreign currency reserves depleted and with more than $200 billion of debt payments coming due, Erdogan is looking to plug an investment gap.

      "['The oil market is finally starting to flicker into life — and nowhere is that clearer than in the prices of crude like Saudi Arabia’s, where output cuts are quietly transforming the supply landscape. The kingdom and its partners in the OPEC+ oil producer alliance have been restraining supply for months now, with relatively little impact on the futures market. Brent oil traded in London had been stuck around the $75-a-barrel mark for weeks. That shifted a little Friday, when the contracts rose to about $78, a level they have largely held at since. But the tiny and tentative rally tells only part of the story. Brent oil differs to the kind produced by Saudi Arabia in two important aspects: its density and sulfur content. And across the world, where varieties of crude more closely resemble those of the world’s top exporter, prices are shooting up faster as refineries clamor for alternatives to the barrels that the kingdom has cut.  Meanwhile supplies of lighter, sweeter oil that’s similar to West Texas Intermediate and Brent, the world’s main futures grades, have been relatively plentiful. “Mediums and heavy sour barrels are becoming increasingly scarce given OPEC+ cuts,” said Michael Tran, managing director at RBC Capital Markets LLC. “Much of the physical looseness in the market has stemmed from lighter, sweeter barrels and sneaky surging US shale production has been under-appreciated.” In the Middle East, important market timespreads — such as inter-month Dubai oil swapsBloomberg Terminal — are also pointing to tighter supplies for what is a flagship price for the region’s medium and heavier sour grades. The rally has created an expectation that Asia’s refiners may look further afield for cargoes.  Oil bulls have pointed to sharp jumps in premiums for refined fuels as a sign that, despite fears of a global economic slowdown, consumption remains healthy.  Even though macroeconomic data suggest a global manufacturing recession, Europe’s diesel benchmark — the fuel most closely linked to the region’s industrial production — last week spiked relative to later months on concerns about scarce supply.  By contrast, some lighter crudes have been hurt by weak demand for products like naphtha amid anemic margins in the petrochemicals industry.  Those moves, alongside relatively robust markets for gasoline and fuel oil, are also shaping the crude refiners look to buy, improving the attractiveness of heavier grades.  Signs of the strength in heavier oil prices can be seen everywhere amid the start of new refineries in the Middle East and Asia, and a longlasting halt in Iraqi oil exports via the Turkish port of Ceyhan. Wildfires in Canada that sent oil production to the lowestBloomberg Terminal in two years are also adding to concerns.  The premium of Norway’s Johan Sverdrup above a regional benchmark surged to a fresh record on Friday, having been at hefty discounts as recently as December. Mars Blend soared to a three-year high last week and industry consultant Energy Aspects forecast the supply of sour grades from the US Gulf Coast to stay tightBloomberg Terminal this quarter. Ongoing purchases by the US government to refill its strategic reserve have also helped boost sour crudes.  Western Canada Select was recently at a discount of $10 to Nymex WTI benchmark prices, which is the strongest level seen since the government of Alberta implemented  an OPEC-style production cut of 325,000 barrels a day between 2019 and 2021.  In contrast, light-sweet supplies such as West Texas Intermediate Midland crude remain relatively well supplied. Record volumes of the flagship US grade have been flooding the European market since its introduction into the region’s physical oil benchmark, Dated Brent. The move has also weighed on prices since it came into effect earlier this year. “The OPEC+ cuts have meant a drop in medium-sour crude supply compared to a growth in light-sweet crude output,” said James Davis, director of short-term oil service at FGE. “For lighter crudes, which typically yield high levels of naphtha, the weak naphtha cracks are also going to be having a negative impact.”  The spread between Abu Dhabi’s Murban crude versus Dubai swaps has been narrowing too. Following Saudi Arabia’s price hike for August-loading barrels, the premium of the comparatively-light Murban started to shrink on a relative basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brent swaps contracts have traded at a rare discount to Dubai swaps in recent days, following a precipitous slide over the past few months.  That slide creates potential pricing arbitrages to entice Asian refineries to purchase long-distance crudes. Some refiners there have already been snapping up millions of US barrels, along with some cargoes from West Africa in the spot market, according to traders.  In the latest move, at least two processors in Asia sought lessBloomberg Terminal from the Saudis for cargoes shipped next month, and another said it won’t take any cargoes after an unexpected price increase. There are signs too that European buyers are taking fewer Saudi barrels. Ultimately that pushes them toward other markets. “To me, it looks like the start of the hot summer in the crude market,” said Jorge Leon, senior vice president of oil market research at Rystad Energy. “It is the tipping point the market was expecting. Fundamentals are finally starting to drive the market.”']\n",

Europe’s busiest commercial waterway is being closely watched for a potential repeat of last summer, when record temperatures meant water levels dropped to a level that rendered the Rhine effectively unnavigable. As well as moving fuels like diesel and heating oil inland, the Rhine also handles coal, chemicals and metals.

Due to high temperature forecasts on the Rhone river, production restrictions are likely to affect the Bugey power station from July 13, EDF said in a regulatory filing Monday. Those restrictions may lead to the halt of one or two reactors at the site, where four units each have 900 megawatts of capacity. For the same reason, output restrictions are likely to be imposed at the Saint Alban plant from July 16, EDF said. One of the two 1.3-gigawatt units on the site is already halted for maintenance.  The river water in these areas isn’t too hot to be used for cooling, but could rise to levels that threaten wildlife if the reactors continue normal operations during a heat wave. For this reason, the levels to which these plants are allowed to increase river temperatures are strictly monitored and controlled. The potential outages are no cause for concerns in terms of security of electricity supply, they are a reminder that EDF will have to keep adapting its atomic plants to warmer temperatures and potential natural disasters caused by global warming. The reduced nuclear output could also force the utility and rivals such as Engie SA and TotalEnergies SE to use more gas to generate power, potentially slowing the filing of storage before next winter.

      "['BlackRock Inc. remains most overweight Chinese stocks in Asia, saying a recent market rout looks overdone as the country’s corporate fundamentals are still solid. Investors are pricing in the “very worst-case scenario” and the market has been “over-punished,” said Lucy Liu, BlackRock’s portfolio manager for global emerging markets equities, at a briefing Tuesday. She cited resilient earnings, more economic stimulus and a stabilization of US-China relations as near-term catalysts.  BlackRock, which oversees about $9.1 trillion in assets globally, turned overweight Chinese equities in February, citing short-term opportunities from the nation’s reopening from Covid curbs. Since then, a suite of Wall Street banks have trimmed their expectations on the world’s second-biggest stock market as the country’s growth recovery faltered. The MSCI China Index has recently fallen into a bear market after dropping more than 20% from a January peak, while the yuan hovered near an eight-month low against the dollar amid worries about an ailing economy. China’s economic slowdown has also shone a spotlight on its hidden local debt, with state-owned banks offering extra lending support to ease a credit crunch. However, BlackRock said it believes the local government debt risks are manageable. “There is very little risk for this issue to become a systemic risk because policy banks and the central government have a strong balance sheet to solve the problem if they need,” said Liu. In the bond universe, BlackRock favors state-owned and high-quality developers as the property crisis unfolds, saying risks may continue to weigh on distressed builders. The yuan may also stabilize in the second half of the year if fresh stimulus materializes and growth picks up, said Yii Hui Wong, BlackRock’s Asia fixed income and credit portfolio manager.  There are still “plenty of bottom-up opportunities in China markets,” Liu said, recommending the tech sector as selected artificial intelligence-related firms should continue to outperform. She also sees opportunities in consumption recovery and industrial automation. There’s a risk of global investors being “too underweight” on China, Liu said. “Any sort of positive data points on economic recovery or any policy stimulus can trigger some positioning aligning or review, as well as some short squeeze in the China market.”']\n",

      "['A type of refinancing transaction is becoming more popular in the $1.3 trillion market for collateralized loan obligations, a sign the industry is healing as concerns over surging inflation and a potential recession abate. Known as resets, these transactions can extend the life of CLOs for years. In the past they’ve made up as much as a third of annual issuance, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But last year’s sharp deterioration in credit conditions all but put the deals on ice. Now, they’re making a comeback. Credit Suisse Asset Management and Oak Hill Advisors have in recent weeks reset liabilities for CLOs that were originally issued during the second half of 2022. Resetting allows the CLOs to essentially cut the costs at which they borrow. That translates to more money leftover for the holders of the riskiest and highest-returning part of the structure, the equity portion, after other note holders have been paid. Bank of America Corp. says there’s around $20 billion of additional CLOs that were issued around the same time — when funding costs reached multiyear highs — that could be reset in the coming months. CLOs sold in the second half of 2022 that can now be called “are ripe for a reset, as liabilities were extremely wide back then,” said Meric Topbas, head of structuring at CSAM’s credit investments group. There were more than 70 such deals over the span, and more than half priced their AAA bonds at a spread of over 2 percentage points, he said, compared with as low as 1.75 percentage points at present. Refinancings and resets for CLOs, which package and sell leveraged loans into chunks of varying risk and return, aren’t that different from those for traditional fixed-income securities.  In refinancings, CLOs are called by the equity holders — who have control over the structure as compensation for being last in line to receive cash flows from the underlying loans — and reissued via lower cost debt, denting payouts for bond holders higher in the capital stack and boosting equity returns. In a reset, the CLO is refinanced, the maturity of the debt is extended and the deal size is sometimes tweaked. If CLO bond holders choose not to participate, new investors are typically brought in. CSAM last month successfully completed a resetBloomberg Terminal that extended a $396 million CLO initially pricedBloomberg Terminal in July of last year. Oak Hill also wrapped up a resetBloomberg Terminal of an upsized $567 million CLO last month, extending a dealBloomberg Terminal originally issued in June of 2022.  “We tightened the liabilities and increased the total size of the CLO without injecting additional equity,” said TK Narayan, portfolio manager and partner at Oak Hill. “We expect to see more resets, so long as they improve the returns for equity holders.” Bank of America’s Pratik Gupta agrees. His team of analysts predicts that refinancings and resets for US CLOs will increase in the near term, and estimate the total volume of potential deals, based on their call periods and spreads, to be close to $20 billion.  The reemergence of resets underscores the extent to which credit conditions have improved in recent months. CSAM’s original transaction had priced the AAA rated tranche at 2.25 percentage points, while the reset came at 1.85 percentage points, some 0.4 percentage point tighter. Some collateral managers priced AAA bondsBloomberg Terminal at spreads as wide as 2.6 percentage points last year. But more reset deals will also add supply to a market that’s struggled to attract enough investors. US banks in particular, once the biggest buyers of AAA tranches, have mostly stayed on the sidelines in recent months amid a decline in deposits and expectations for increased capital requirements.  And Japan’s Norinchukin Bank, once one of the world’s biggest buyers, has said it plans to keep CLO holdings around current levels. “The 2022 deals are relatively new deals with minimal deterioration in the loan portfolio quality,” said Vince Pompliano, managing director and co-head of CLO Platform at Benefit Street Partners. “They look similar to new issue deals right now.” Of course, the universe of potential refinancings is just a fraction of the total market, and the vast majority of CLOs have little incentive to reset at present, market watchers say. For more, subscribe to the Structured Finance Weekly Resets are also expected in Europe, though later in the year given 2022 deals from the region often had longer periods in which the debt can’t be called. BofA European CLO strategist Dustin Walpert said in an interview that about an estimated €3 billion ($3.3 billion) of CLOs should be ripe for resets.  “In Europe we’re not expecting to see refis or resets happen until the third or fourth quarter this year,” Walpert said. “There are only a few deals that both issued at very wide spreads last year and are exiting their non-call period later this year.”']\n",

      "['China’s new loans accelerated in June after a central bank interest rate cut in the middle of the month aimed at boosting credit demand. New corporate medium and long-term loans — which reflect investment demand — improved from a high level recorded in the same month last year. New household mid and long-term loans, a proxy for mortgages, also increased slightly from last year. “It seems that the government has successfully directed more lending to corporates,” said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA. “The data offers hope that infrastructure investment is now being stepped up to stabilize growth after the drastic slowdown in April and May.” The figures also provides hope that the economy will see faster sequential growth in the second half of the year after the slump in the second quarter, according to Lam. But infrastructure alone will not be enough given the weak housing market and private-sector confidence, and more easing is still needed to ensure China can comfortably exceed its moderate growth target of around 5% this year, she said. The better-than-expected result is also likely to be taken with a grain of salt by investors. Banks usually rush to extend loans at the end of each quarter to meet their lending targets, resulting in a spike in credit in certain months including June. The year-on-year growth rate of broad money supply and the stock of credit both slowed from a month ago and point to a deceleration in financing activities. It is unclear whether the improvement came from a push to increase loans from policymakers or real organic growth, but the economic recovery lost more steam in June despite the rate cut and the jump in lending. Manufacturing activities contracting for the third straight month, while the expansion of the services sector also slowed. Borrowing demand has been sluggish in recent month, and the interest rates for bankers’ acceptances declined in the last two weeks of the month. That suggests banks were trading more with each other in a bid to boost credit growth and meet their targets for extending loans — a sign of weak credit demand from companies and households. The PBOC repeated a pledge to maintain “reasonable growth” of credit at a “stable pace” during a monetary policy committee meeting at the end of June. The meeting was attended by Pan Gongsheng, who was appointed party chief of the central bank earlier this month.   Economists expect the PBOC to ease monetary policy further this year to support the economy, with moderate cuts to interest rates and moves to reduce the amount of cash banks must set in reserve. More Chinese people are seeing their incomes drop and expect house prices to fall, according to a recent PBOC survey, underscoring weak consumer confidence. ']\n",

      "['Irish commercial property deals slumped to one of the lowest levels ever recorded in the second quarter, as investors shied away from the market amid rising borrowing costs. Just 26 deals with a combined value of €333 million ($367 million) were closed during the three months between April and June, according to research by real estate broker Sherry Fitzgerald Group. Activity in the period was sharply lower than during the first quarter.  In the first six months of 2023, total spending in properties such as offices, warehouses and retail space dropped by more than half to €985 million compared with the same period a year ago, the report said. “The rising borrowing cost environment has played its part in muting investor activity,” said Jean Behan, senior economist at Sherry Fitzgerald.  Commercial property markets across Europe have seized as buyers and sellers struggle to agree on pricing. Rising interest rates have driven up financing costs, prompting potential investors to demand higher yields. That results in lower offer prices, and owners are resisting granting steep discounts to book values on concerns that could cause debt ratios to surge.  The drop in activity in Ireland mirrors declines elsewhere in Europe. French commercial real estate volumes dropped by more than 60% in the second quarter, while the sector in Germany saw the number of deals plunge to their lowest level since at least 2017 in the first half of the year. In June, Central Bank of Ireland Governor Gabriel Makhlouf warned that commercial real estate markets were “particularly vulnerable” to a rapid tightening of global monetary policy. Almost six in ten Irish commercial property deals closed in the opening half of 2023 were valued at less than €10 million, with just 11% exceeding a valuation of €50 million, Behan added.  Vilnius, Lithuania, this week rang with good intentions. They came from every member at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit, even if differences persist about Ukraine’s possible membership of the alliance. Yet a harsher judgment about what is taking place — the yawning gulf between words and deeds — is emphasized by the dire state of weapons procurement on both sides of the Atlantic. The US is in a better place than Europe, but even NATO’s mightiest nation faces serious difficulties in sustaining its aid to Ukraine. Forget for a moment cluster munitions, the focus of heated words in Vilnius. Consider the astounding reality that the US is obliged to borrow or purchase conventional artillery ammunition from South Korea to sustain shipments to the Ukrainians. We shall return later to the empty shelves in US arsenals. First, Europe’s condition is much worse. The International Institute of Strategic Studies, in its latest journal, delivers this withering verdict in an authoritative study: “The armed forces in European NATO and European Union member states are hollowed out, plagued by unserviceable equipment and severely depleted ammunition stocks.” The weakness of Europe’s stockpiles, together with the continent’s limited capacity to renew them, “raises urgent questions about European industry’s ability to continue supporting Ukraine militarily at scale and at speed, and its ability to recapitalize forces in NATO and the EU.” More than a year ago, the German government \\xad— to name the most grievous offender — committed itself to a €100 billion rebuild of its threadbare armed forces.  Today, however, an estimated 1% of the promised defense boost has been spent. Last month’s inaugural German National Security Strategy, instead of emphasizing the determination of Europe’s greatest economic power, instead underlined its weakness. The political will is absent in Germany, as it is in other European states (with the notable exceptions of Poland and the Baltic and Nordic nations), to take effective action either to strengthen their armed forces or to sustain Ukraine’s munitions. Even in Britain, which has done more to aid Ukraine than any other European country, there is a visceral aversion to increasing defense spending. A distinguished Conservative Party elder statesman recently took issue with my pleas for rearmament: “If the Russians cannot defeat such a second-class power as Ukraine on the battlefield, how can we believe that NATO has anything to fear from Putin?” I responded that we are appallingly vulnerable to Russian harassment — for instance, of our undersea infrastructure — not to mention our incapacity to support US forces in a serious way against China, if that ever becomes necessary. Above all, I stressed our inability to contribute effectively to sustaining the arms flow to Ukraine. Yet my friend remains unconvinced, as do hundreds of millions of Europeans, preoccupied with their own domestic problems, which are many and various, as the French riots bear witness. Few people understand the remarkably protracted lead times necessary to increase arms production. Two or three years between commitment and delivery of even some basic munitions and materials is standard. Those NATO nations still accustomed to fight at all — meaning mostly the US, UK and France — have focused upon relatively small outputs. The factories do not exist to provide long runs of — for instance — conventional artillery ammunition any time soon.   Britain’s BAE Systems recently told the Pentagon it would require at least 30 months to restart production of M777 howitzers, among the most vital weapons in Ukraine’s defense; a new £190 million deal with the British government for 155mm shells will have a similarly lengthy timeline. Germany’s Rheinmetall quotes at least a year for renovation and modernization of battle tanks, given production times of specialized steel and electronic components. Prices for raw materials used in arms production but not mined in EU countries have risen astronomically. The French government recently asked MBDA Missile Systems to increase its production of Mistral air-defense systems from 20 units per month, and has been offered only an increase to perhaps 40 monthly by 2025. The German armed forces face an ammunition shortfall demanding €20 billion worth of new orders. At the current speed of contract placement, it will be 20 years before this is achieved. Susanne Wiegand, CEO of RENK Group, which makes drivetrains for tanks, said in February that only a trickle of new orders had come in. Meanwhile, some manufacturers are obliged to struggle against the wider commercial difficulties of their owners. Britain’s Rolls-Royce has cut investment internationally following severe corporate difficulties. It owns the German-based mtu, which provides engines for tanks and armored vehicles. Yet mtu’s efforts to hire more staff and expand production are at odds with Rolls-Royce’s cutbacks elsewhere.  Moreover, all the big manufacturers are wary of funding expansion, only to find the Ukraine war suddenly ending or governments continuing to resist rearmament. It would be unjust to denounce corporate Europe for short-termism when it is at the mercy of governments reluctant to plan beyond next Tuesday.  European nations are attempting to strengthen cooperation to diminish wasteful duplication — today, some 15 companies in 11 EU member states have a capability to produce 155mm ammunition. The new European Defense Fund, committed to sharing R&D resources, should represent a step in the right direction, but it will be years before it yields a payoff.  The IISS study concludes that belief in the permanence of America’s protective shield still causes Europe’s governments to shortchange defense.  Despite all the fine words since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “no major recapitalization of armed forces or large-scale procurement to address capability has yet materialized” — even in Britain, which beats its chest loudest in defiance of Moscow.  Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the US too struggles to produce munitions in credible quantities for sustained combat. In World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill trumpeted the role of America as “the arsenal of democracy.” Today, Washington is struggling to make good on such a claim. Michael Brenes, a lecturer in history at Yale, has authored a new study that mirrors those of European critics of their own continent’s performance.  Brenes writes that President Joe Biden’s lofty rhetoric about America’s role in providing weapons for Ukraine “does not match the reality on the ground.” He continues: “Shortages in production, inadequate labor pools and interruptions in supply chains have hamstrung the United States’ ability to deliver weapons to Ukraine and to enhance [US] defense capabilities more broadly.” During World War II, the US government owned almost 90% of the nation’s productive capacity of aircraft, ships, guns and ammunitions. Today, private industry accounts for nearly all new procurement. Such dependence on contractors dates as far back as the Korean War, but intensified during the Vietnam years. Moreover, many parts of key weapons systems are now produced abroad; the supply chain for the F-35 fighter, the most expensive military contract in history, included a magnet sourced from China. Even such big spenders as former President Ronald Reagan emphasized mega-projects such as the MX Missile, B-2 stealth bomber and F-22 stealth fighter, along with the doomed Strategic Defense Initiative, at the expense of boring old conventional weapons. When the defense budget was cut deeply at the end of the Cold War, tens of thousands of defense jobs were lost, and the numbers of manufacturers shrank dramatically. There are today three contractors for tactical missiles, against more than a dozen three decades ago, and just two makers of fighter aircraft.  Private equity has played as doleful a role in defense as in many other industries, drastically reducing numbers of small contractors that manufacture minor components that Ukrainians desperately need, but which are only marginally profitable. China is building major items of defense equipment five times faster than the US. Maintenance delays, especially in the Navy, are crippling combat readiness. Earlier this year, William LaPlante, the under secretary of defense for acquisition, told the New York Times that the US “really allowed production lines to go cold and watched as parts became obsolete.”   Despite the war in Europe, big US contractors are fighting most fiercely for the big-ticket programs — ICBMs, stealth bombers and the like — rather than the relatively low-tech stuff the Ukrainians need urgently. US armed forces, even when fighting in such limited conflicts as Iraq and Afghanistan, struggled against shortages of ammunition and equipment.  Today’s shortfalls are far more severe, because in Ukraine millions of men and women are fighting for survival. In the early months of the war, Ukraine sometimes expended up to 500 Javelin anti-armor weapons in a single day — burning through a third of the US stockpile in the first weeks of the conflict. Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, which now jointly produce 2,100 Javelins a year, say they will  double that figure — but not until 2025 at the earliest. Such shortages of relatively low-tech weapons help to explain Washington’s new commitment to dispatch cluster munitions, which are banned by most US allies for their threat to civilians. Critics of that decision refuse to recognize how little else is immediately available if cluster bombs are not sent. Ukraine, to a considerable extent, depends on munitions shipped through third parties by South Korea, 56% of whose voters oppose direct military aid. Seoul is selling $13.7 billion worth of tanks, jet and other munitions to Poland. In 2023, it is shipping hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, some of them to the US, enabling transfers to Ukraine. Michael Brenes concludes: “The United States cannot be an arsenal of democracy to Ukraine, or to any country, if it does not better align its foreign and domestic policies [and] invest more in Americans’ futures” — through a long-term commitment to a new generation of skilled workers. Meanwhile, how are the Russians faring? Their materiel as well as human losses since February 2022 have been immense. Perhaps the most credible open-source study of Putin’s procurement predicament was recently conducted by the Swedish Defense Research Agency. It concludes that Russia faces not so much a shortage of tanks, weapons and military equipment generally, but is obliged to rely increasingly on older materiel as its most modern kit is destroyed. Most significantly, the report states: “Russia’s intensive use of ammunition is not tenable.” Half of an estimated prewar stockpile of 16 million shells was used in the war’s first year, and some of the munitions being fired today show rust damage. To sustain Russia’s 2022 expenditure of shells would require factory production of almost six million a year, an impossible number.  How the war unfolds in the coming months depends in part on how effectively NATO arms Ukraine, but also on North Korean, Iranian and Chinese supplies to Russia. Whatever the outcome of the war, say the authors, President Vladimir Putin’s nation will require years to rebuild its prewar capabilities.  Unfortunately, this view confirms the skepticism of many Western politicians, including the British elder statesman I cited above, about diverting billions to our own rearmament. Yet Russia retains some advantages over the West: Because its economy and industries are subject to direct control from the Kremlin, Putin can focus his nation’s arms production on the munitions he needs most in Ukraine.   Although many of the right things were said in Vilnius this week, it is essential to acknowledge the seriousness of NATO’s procurement crisis. A study of its European forces published last month, written by former British Army Brigadier Ben Barry and a cluster of other strategy gurus, asserted that “an important question is whether European allies are more serious now” about rearmament “than they were after Ukraine was first invaded in 2014.” The chief of the German Army, Lieutenant General Alfons Mais, has repeatedly asserted that his country has “fallen behind its own ambitions” to rearm.  We inhabit an era when few Western governments can muster the political support to address meaningfully big, difficult issues, of which climate change is foremost, but defense and the rebuilding of crumbling infrastructure come close behind. In a world full of threats, among which China presents a far graver menace than Russia, we shall be profoundly foolish if we fail to retool our industries and rearm our militaries. Ukraine is a historic test of Western will and staying power. Not for the first time in history, the outcome of the struggle will be determined not only on battlefields, but also in the factories of the West.

      "['Andrew Left is behind the wheel of a dark gray Range Rover cruising through Beverly Hills with the windows down on a cool morning. Though he’s sworn off smoking, he’s looking to buy a pack of Marlboro Lights. Two years after FBI agents showed up at his California home to seize computers and phones, the short seller who terrorized more than 100 companies and riled an army of meme-stock traders is describing what it’s like to feel hunted. His pioneering firm, Citron Research, no longer has investors. He’s all but stopped pitching ideas publicly. He even wiped his once-feared Twitter account. Left is living in limbo, waiting to learn if the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission plan to charge him in their sweeping investigations of tactics used by activist short sellers. After emerging as one of the first figures to draw scrutiny in the probe of potential market manipulation, Left says prosecutors stopped reaching out more than nine months ago – leaving him to wonder whether they’ve gone away or are closing in. “Three nights ago, I woke up and looked at my email and it says ‘DOJ letter,’ and I’m like ‘Oh, here it is,’” Left said. It turned out to be a draft letter one of his lawyers wrote asking the Justice Department for an update.  Even deliveries rattle him. “Imagine living like that. When my dogs bark at the gate for Amazon, I’m like someone’s there. It’s scarring.” His predicament shows how the dragnet – gathering communications involving dozens of bearish investors and their researchers – has shaken the raucous business of activist short selling, prompting some such as Left and Muddy Waters’s Carson Block to at least pause their work or adopt more restraint. Altogether, the number of major new campaigns slumped 16% to 113 last year, according to Breakout Point, which tracks bearish investors. That’s helped clear the field for a rising generation, such as Hindenburg Research’s Nate Anderson, who’s made waves this year targeting empires controlled by Indian tycoon Gautam Adani and Wall Street legend Carl Icahn. Anxiety over the Justice Department’s investigation intensified several weeks ago when the head of its market integrity and major frauds unit predicted at a legal conference that the public will start seeing results within a few months. He didn’t elaborate. Since then, short sellers have buzzed over who among them might be in the crosshairs. Spokespeople for the Justice Department and SEC declined to comment.  The probe began ramping up a few years ago as the House Financial Services Committee was embarking on a series of hearings into what the panel’s chairwoman, California Democrat Maxine Waters, called “predatory short selling.” In rare moments of bipartisan agreement, lawmakers across the spectrum expressed concern that short sellers were hurting everyday investors while reaping billions of dollars for themselves. Critics cited academic studies questioning whether market manipulation, rather than the strength of bearish research, better explained violent drops in stocks. Some embattled executives said bearish traders were teaming up to topple viable-yet-vulnerable companies.  “It can have a cascading event on the share price,” said Paul Pelletier, a former federal prosecutor who’s represented a company shorted by an activist. “That can drive a company out of business regardless of whether the information is true or not.” Federal investigators haven’t specified what or who they’re examining, nor have they accused anybody of misconduct. The inquiries could end without any charges.   “I have no idea what this investigation is about,” Left said during an almost five-hour interview that began with a breakfast of bagels and lox at the London West Hollywood hotel before driving around town. “Imagine explaining that to your kids, to your family. I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong. It’s cost me a lot of money, a lot of stress, and I don’t know why. Not to mention, it changed my life.” At one point, he asked for a hug. Even by Wall Street standards, short sellers are famously high strung. They see conspiracies everywhere. The bets they place – typically borrowing stock and selling it in the hopes of buying it back cheaper for a profit – can generate steep gains or losses, ensuring a roller coaster of emotions. To those who track those dramas, Left’s origin story is well known: Raised by a deli worker and an office secretary, he answered a newspaper ad in his 20s for a $100,000 job selling commodities. He found himself in a boiler-room operation — a notorious offshoot of Wall Street where armies of brokers work phones to pitch lackluster stocks to rubes. He didn’t stay long and was soon trading against what he saw as scams. At 30, he took what he had learned, and $50,000 of his savings, to go public with his trading ideas. He launched a website and named his firm Citron to target the type of lemon stocks he used to sell. That first decade was lonely. But as Chinese companies flocked to US markets, more activists including Block made names for themselves pointing out accounting irregularities. Soon, hedge funds were vying for pieces of the action. Now 53, Left estimates he’s published around 200 reports over the years. Well over a dozen of the companies he targeted were later delisted or filed for bankruptcy. At several of them, US authorities followed up with civil or criminal charges against executives. Examples include Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which Left accused of being at the center of an illicit sales scheme. When then-US Attorney Preet Bharara later announced charges against two executives linked to the company, he referenced the role that investor websites and news organizations played. But increasingly, companies under pressure fought back, turning to courts, lawmakers and federal investigators for help. Left has battled lawsuits by jilted executives and for a time was barred from trading stocks in Hong Kong. Now, he argues, the US government is focusing on the wrong side. “I’ve found more bad players than anyone else,” he said after stubbing out a cigarette just off Sunset Boulevard. “Where’s my White House visit?” Activist short sellers typically line up positions, publish research and wait for the stock to fall. Some cover their bets in minutes, giving antagonists – including angry corporate executives – little chance to drive up the price to squeeze bearish wagers. Left said that strategy helps manage risks, that his research is honest and that he deserves to be rewarded for pointing out wrongdoing. “When you’re an activist short seller, your informational advantage over the street is around a half an hour,” he said. “For three months, while you were at your kid’s baseball game, I was investigating a fraud. While you were watching Netflix with your wife, I was up all night working.” Other activists, such as Marc Cohodes, deride that quick retreat as “smash and grab,” criticizing the practice as unethical and possibly illegal. It gives the public little time to check the validity of research as the stock starts diving. Critics also argue that bearish investors too often leave the impression they’re maintaining a short bet long after they’ve walked away. Left said he may keep a portion of his position in play in case the shares fall further. What he won’t do, he said, is close out and bet on a rebound. Even if he did, Left isn’t sure that would be against the law. “‘Smash’ is the wrong word because that means forcefully entering something that shouldn’t be entered,” Left said. “What about instead of ‘smash and grab,’ I said ‘expose and grab?’ Is that as bad?” The government’s hunt for communications indicates it’s examining whether firms act in concert, potentially amplifying a report’s impact on a stock. US rules bar some specific trading practices that could, theoretically, manipulate a stock by artificially signaling the start of a price swing. They include spoofing, in which traders rapidly submit and cancel orders, and matched trading, which usually involves a few parties setting up trades at certain levels. Left said he doesn’t even know what those terms mean. “I could understand if the government thought there was a short selling cabal out there,” Left said. “Like we all get together and go ‘Hey, let’s go destroy companies.’ This doesn’t work like that.” Short bets don’t always work out. Two years ago, Left got burned when armies of retail traders organized on message boards such as Reddit and set out to squeeze firms such as Citron and Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital that were betting heavily against stocks such as GameStop Corp. or AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. That meme-stock frenzy not only put pressure on Citron, it fueled personal attacks against Left and his family. Some antagonists sent messages to his kids’ Snapchat and social media accounts. For the first time, Left said, his kids understood what he did for a living. Ironically, Left considers his GameStop loss one of his wisest moments. That’s because he covered his position when the stock reached $92 and before margin requirements became unbearable. “The best trade I’ve ever made in my whole life was getting out. How crazy is that?” he said. If he had stayed two days longer, he estimates he would have been wiped out. That’s when it dawned on Left that the game he’d played for years had changed: The public saw him as the establishment he had set out to challenge. In late January 2021, he sat in front of his computer to record a video announcing he was ending publication of short-sale research. As he wrapped up, a group of federal agents were nearing his home with a search warrant for his phones and computers. The problem was, the feds had gone to his house in Beverly Hills while he was at his place in Boca Raton, Florida. A friend staying at the California house called, and later that day Left turned over his materials to the feds. A few months later, Left unexpectedly became the primary parent to his two eldest children when his ex-wife died. “So now I’m having GameStop, DOJ and being a hands-on dad,” Left said. “I’ve never had to be a hands-on dad.” On the day of the interview, that meant making sure one of his sons got to a skate park and fetching medicine for his daughter, who wasn’t feeling well. Meanwhile, as part of its sweeping probe, the Justice Department has subpoenaed a variety of other market participants, such as Block and Toronto-based Anson Funds, seeking communications, calendars and other records relating to almost 30 investment and research firms, as well as three dozen individuals associated with them. The SEC followed up with its own inquiries. The subpoenas refer to a broad look into possible manipulation through collusion or insider trading. Left said he received another subpoena last year seeking information on trading in blue chip stocks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Once word of the investigation became public, Left said the consequences were immediate. “You go to apply to a country club or you go try to get your kid into a private school and the first thing that comes up is ‘Oh God, the FBI, the DOJ,’” Left said. Not to mention the impact on his business: “I’ve been taken out of the loop. Who’s going to feed me information or talk stocks with me? I wouldn’t talk stocks with me.” Left hasn’t stepped back entirely. In April, he released a report on a financial services firm in Kazakhstan. In May, the company said it wouldn’t file an annual report on time because an audit wasn’t finished. Last month, the Nasdaq Stock Market warned the company could be delisted. Yet, every so often, Left is reminded he’s still being watched. Shortly after he deleted his Twitter account in March, the SEC reached out asking for a copy of all the tweets he ever published. “I’m like, you already have all the tweets,” Left said. “It doesn’t go away. Just Google.” Despite that defiance, he’s clearly on edge. In the hotel lobby, Left pauses at a television to read aloud a CNN headline that the Justice Department had warned Donald Trump he’s the target of an investigation. Left ponders that bit of the process. “OK, there you go,” he said, lost in thought for a moment. “I don’t know what that means for me.”']\n"
